RENDEL PALMER & TRITTON has won its second roads contract in Ghana within a
few months. It has been commissioned to update earlier detailed design and
assist in letting the tender for an EC-funded project to build a new road
along an existing 54km unpaved road alignment west of Kumasi.
The road will be useful for the timber and cocoa export industries and runs
through the primary and secondary rainforest of the Brong-Ahafo region of
Western Ghana. Its sub-standard alignment and propensity to flooding renders
the road unusable at certain times of the year.
The earlier work involved evaluation and design improvements to enable the
road to accommodate higher traffic volumes and heavier lorries.
