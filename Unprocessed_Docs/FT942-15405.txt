The ubiquitous plastic fizzy drinks bottle has been given a new life - as
the uppers in the latest casual shoes.
One of America's biggest shoe makers, Bass, of Portland, Maine, has recycled
the bottles into polyester fibres which are then woven into the fabric for
men's and ladies' shoes. The bottles are ground down into crystals, then
made into a flax and woven into a yarn. The dyes used to colour the fibres
are biodegradable.
