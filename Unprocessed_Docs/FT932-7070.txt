NEGOTIATIONS on China's bid to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade resumed this week, but Gatt members appear to be in little hurry to
admit China to the 111-nation body.
Nearly seven years after China asked for Gatt membership, trading partners
have not even agreed what should go into the country's draft protocol of
accession. Much of this week's meeting remains concerned with clarification
of its trade policy.
Recent talks have been slowed by the tense trade relations between China and
the US, including conditions for renewal of its Most Favoured Nation status.
However, many Gatt members share US concern that, without special
safeguards, they could be swamped by a flood of cheap Chinese exports.
China opposes special safeguards and wants entry terms to reflect its status
as a developing country. However, recent international comparisons show
China as the world's third biggest economy with a per capita income of
Dollars 1,450 (Pounds 945), four times previous estimates.
