Sir, I am delighted that Lex (August 18) has reflected that 90 per cent of
UK house owners are not burdened by 'negative equity' and that fear of
unemployment is the most influential factor for potential house buyers.
But I should point out that I, as an intending first-time buyer, am
uninterested in the prospects for house price rises. Instead, I am
interested in when prices are likely to stop falling. The difference may
seem academic in the world of economic forecasting. But in buying a house in
which to live (not to 'do up and sell'), as long as I do not pay more than
necessary, I do not care if house prices never rise again.
I don't think I am alone in this view. Inflation in house prices is as bad a
curse as any other kind of inflation.
