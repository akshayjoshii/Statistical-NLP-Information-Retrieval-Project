Cosby Gets Help From 'The Simpsons': NBC won't accept commercials featuring characters from "The Simpsons" because it doesn't want to cross-promote a program on a competing network. But that doesn't mean that NBC stars can't put their commercials on during "The Simpsons." In fact, Bill Cosby, who will go head-to-spikey head with Bart Simpson when the animated series moves to Thursday night in the fall, was seen Sunday during "The Simpsons" plugging his upcoming "Ghost Dad" flick.
