Sir, I was most heartened to read Diane Summers' report ('Support For
Flexible Pension Age', June 15) that the majority of managers favour a
flexible retirement age - and a larger pension the later people retire.
Age Concern England has long been in favour of a flexible 'decade of
retirement' giving individuals the choice as to when they retire. People
should be able to choose whether to continue to work or draw a pension over
a given age range, for example, 60 to 70.
Both men and women should be able to draw an adequate pension at 60,
otherwise the choice to retire at this age with enough to live on will only
be accessible to those with substantial private pensions or investment
income.
Although there would be considerable cost involved in providing full
pensions to both sexes at 60, Age Concern England believes this is an option
the government should give full and detailed attention to before any final
decision is made about pension ages. It is time for a 'decade of choice' not
restrictions.
