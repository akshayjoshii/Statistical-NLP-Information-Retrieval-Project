Businesses venturing into cyberspace are well advised to observe the
'netiquette' established by the community of researchers and computer
enthusiasts who still dominate most of the 'newsgroups', or special interest
discussion groups, on the Internet.
Rule number one is that any attempt at unsolicited business promotion is
unacceptable, except in areas of the Internet specifically designated for
commercial activity. Violators of this rule are regarded as the on-line
equivalent of vandals who daub buildings with graffiti, and they are likely
to provoke angry responses, known as 'flame mail'.
In extreme cases, this can effectively force violators off the Internet. A
US legal firm, for example, has been ostracised by the Internet community
for posting on thousands of newsgroups messages that advertised its services
to immigrants seeking US visas.
Outraged Net users bombarded the law firm with over 35,000 messages, most of
them complaints, crashing the computer of the local Internet access service
through which the law firm accessed the Internet.
This incident, together with rising concern about the distribution of
sexually explicit messages on the Internet, has created broad debate about
freedom of speech in the world of electronic communications. Until more
specific guidelines are developed, businesses looking for customers on the
Internet should tread carefully.
