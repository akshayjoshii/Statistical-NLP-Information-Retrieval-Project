US and Russian officials yesterday clinched a Dollars 700m (Pounds 455m)
package of concessional agricultural credits and donations for Moscow,
Reuter reports from Washington.
The package, announced by President Bill Clinton at his April summit with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, was nearly derailed several times.
The Russians had baulked at the terms for shipping the food. In addition, US
shipowners complained their vessels were being held up and charged
unexpected fees at Russian ports. Russia now had agreed to ensure rapid
unloading of commodities at its ports, a US official said.
