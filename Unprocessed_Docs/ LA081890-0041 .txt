I demand that The Times find someone to review country music who knows what he/she is doing. 
I attended the George Strait concert and I'm very disappointed with Robert Hilburn's Aug. 14 potshots at a singer just named country entertainer of the year! 
I am not a barefoot country bumpkin. I am a professional in Beverly Hills who grew up in L.A. There are a lot of us who appreciate the values, morals and smooth presentation of country music.
