An attorney for National League umpire Bob Engel refused to accept a plea bargain to charges that Engel stole baseball cards from two stores in Bakersfield. 
Engel has pleaded not guilty to shoplifting seven boxes containing 4,180 baseball cards from a Target store April 21 and trying to steal 50 packs of baseball cards from Costco in January. The complaint lists the total value in both counts at less than $200.
