The U.S. Air Force canceled all its air shows in West Germany for 1989, six months after the Ramstein Air Base crash that killed 70 people and injured hundreds, a military spokesman at the base said. Three Italian stunt jets collided in flight over Ramstein on Aug. 28, and one of the flaming planes plowed into a crowd of spectators. That crash, and a series of allied training flight crashes in West Germany last year that killed more than 100 people, caused a public outcry and demands for a stop to low-level military flights.
