White House chief of staff Thomas 'Mack' McLarty is to be replaced by the
budget director Leon Panetta as part of a top-level shake-up, President Bill
Clinton announced last night. McLarty, a boyhood friend of Mr Clinton, was
due to remain in the White House as the senior adviser to the president.
McLarty has come under fire for the loose organisation of White House staff.
Critics have complained he was not tough enough with his staff or with
Clinton's opponents.
