Quarterback Doug Flutie, 27, a free agent since being released by the New England Patriots after last season, signed with the British Columbia Lions of the Canadian Football League Monday night. 
Details of the agreement weren't immediately announced. 
"I'm very excited and happy," the 1984 Heisman Trophy winner said. "I'm here to stay. I'm not going home after all." 
British Columbia has four quarterbacks in training camp, including rookie Major Harris of West Virginia, who finished third in last year's Heisman balloting. He was drafted in the 12th round by the Raiders.
