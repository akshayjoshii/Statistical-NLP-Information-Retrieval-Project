The rejection of Tower should sound a warning to all. Tower was denied the post because of alcohol abuse. It is time for everyone to remember that alcohol is a drug and drug abuse will get you. Just because alcohol has been maintained as a legal drug by a well-entrenched industry does not mean that it is not a dangerous drug. MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) is a household word because alcohol abuse is fatally dangerous. 
We all look at derelicts sleeping in the streets, clutching their bottles of booze, and say, "That could never happen to me." Look at Tower and ask yourself, "Could that happen to me?" If your answer is, "Nah, I just drink to have fun," then you, too, have a drug problem.
