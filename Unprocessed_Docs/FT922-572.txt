Embarrassment all round at Switzerland Inc at the unveiling of a huge new
clock marking the central meeting point at Zurich's main rail-way station.
The 8ft-square clock, seen by 300,000 people a day, sports the bright red
logo of Citizen, Japan's leading watch-maker. More galling still, the clock
itself is Swiss, being made by Zurich's own Theodor Beyer. Citizen simply
beat its Swiss competitors to claim the choice advertising space.
The country's Federal Railways, which sold the space, protests its
innocence. It offered the opportunity to all watch-makers, but the Japanese
company was the only one to jump.
Citizen was delighted to have the chance to outsmart its leading Swiss rival
SMH, producer of the phenomenally successful Swatch. which has been making
life miserable for its Japanese competitors on several fronts. It has even
undercut them on sales of watch parts in Hong Kong.
Even so, the Swiss contingent will have the home defeat staring them in the
face for a good while yet. Citizen's contract runs until 1996, with an
optional further three years.
