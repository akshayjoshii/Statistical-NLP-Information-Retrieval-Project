CIMENTS Francais, the French cement producer, said yesterday it was offering
Pta4,587 a share for the remaining 22 per cent of Cementos Rezola, the
biggest producer in Spain's Basque Country, which it does not already
control.
The offer would cost Ciments Francais some Dollars 44m, and has been set at
a premium of 93 per cent of Rezola's current share price.
Ciments Francais has already said it plans to delist Rezola once it gains
full control. The Basque producer will probably be absorbed into Ciments
Francais' larger Spanish affiliate, Financiera y Minera, one of Spain's
biggest cement producers.
The Ciments Francais offer comes just a few days after Corporacion Banesto,
the industrial arm of the Banesto banking group, offered a premium of 32 per
cent to buy out and delist Sanson, another cement producer from northern
Spain.
Analysts say the moves reflect further consolidation in the Spanish cement
sector.
