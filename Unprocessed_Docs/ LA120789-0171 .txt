Telecommunications Deal Expected: An international consortium including San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis is expected to be awarded a license today to build West Germany's first private cellular telephone system. The deal could be worth billions in revenue for Pacific Telesis, the parent of Pacific Bell and owner of a 26% stake in the consortium. Pacific Telesis' partners are West Germany's Mannesmann AG and DG-Bank, along with Britain's Cable & Wireless PLC and France's Lyonnaise des Eaux.
