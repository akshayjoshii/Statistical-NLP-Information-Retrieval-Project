Scientists yesterday reported significant promise in the century-long
struggle to develop a vaccine against malaria, Reuter reports from
Washington.
Malaria kills up to 1m children each year in Africa, and there are up to
500m cases of the disease each year globally. Moreover, the disease is
showing resistance to drugs traditionally used to treat it.
Scientists working for a special tropical disease programme jointly
sponsored by the UN Development Programme, the World Bank and the World
Health Organisation said a vaccine known as SPf66 has shown promising
results in the first phases of human trials in a region of Africa with
rampant malaria.
A final phase of human tests of the vaccine, under way in Tanzania, Gambia,
Colombia and Thailand, will determine whether SPf66 actually reduces the
number of malaria attacks. If those tests are successful, a vaccine could be
available for widespread use by 1998.
