Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are continuing to look for arsonists who scorched a Tujunga synagogue and spray-painted it with anti-Semitic graffiti, including a Nazi swastika and the initials of the Ku Klux Klan. 
A Fire Department spokesman said no witnesses had been found to the fire at the Verdugo Hills Hebrew Center in the 10200 block of Tujunga Canyon Boulevard. The gasoline fire last Sunday morning caused about $5,000 damage to the center's fire-resistant doors but burned out before firefighters arrived at 1 p.m. 
The fire was reported by synagogue members who smelled smoke when they entered the building.
