Bryan Williams of San Diego State's basketball team was restored to good standing by Coach Jim Brandenburg Monday after a one-game suspension, but he might not have regained his starting job. 
Williams, senior point guard from St. Bernard High School in Playa del Rey, sat out the Air Force game in Colorado Springs last Saturday because he had violated curfew in Ft. Collins, Colo., after the Colorado State game two nights earlier. BOB WOLF
