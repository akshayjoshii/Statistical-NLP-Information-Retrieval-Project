All 23 crew members aboard a leaking Liberian-flag freighter were plucked to safety Thursday after their vessel began sinking during rough weather, an official at Japan's Maritime Safety Agency said. An air force helicopter flew the 12 Filipino, four Chinese and five Hong Kong men and one Burmese to the western Japanese city of Kyoto from the 7,027-ton Maritime Gardenia.
