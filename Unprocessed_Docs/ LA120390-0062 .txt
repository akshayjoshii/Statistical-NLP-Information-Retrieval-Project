The government announced Sunday that it is setting up a new agency to produce a biography immortalizing President Saddam Hussein. 
The official Iraqi News Agency said the National Assembly has passed a law giving the new body the sole mandate of preparing a true account of Hussein's life. 
It said the law is aimed at "documenting the biography of His Excellency President Saddam Hussein in an accurate manner to immortalize his leading and historic role in the national construction of Iraq politically, economically, militarily and intellectually."
