Exxon will spread fertilizer on oil-soaked Alaskan beaches in a test effort to accelerate the growth of natural bacteria that break down toxic hydrocarbons from oil, the Environmental Protection Agency said. Under an agreement with the EPA, Exxon will apply nitrogen and phosphorous to about two acres of beach along the southern shore of Snug Harbor on Knight Island, one of the areas of Prince William Sound hardest hit by the 11 million gallons of oil spilled by the supertanker Exxon Valdez on March 24. The nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients intended to stimulate the growth of native microorganisms in the sound that "eat" certain toxic elements of the spilled crude oil. The experiment, which is to begin Thursday, could result in the breakdown of toxic hydrocarbons within two to three years rather than the five- to 10-year period required under normal circumstances, said Dick Valentinetti of EPA's Office of Research and Development.
