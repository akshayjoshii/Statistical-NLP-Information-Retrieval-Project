Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, was discharged from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh 17 days after undergoing a second liver transplant. 
The 12-year-old girl from White Settlement, Tex., will remain in the city for about two weeks for outpatient treatment, hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon said. Stormie received her second liver transplant in a 10-hour operation Feb. 20. She had undergone a heart-and-liver transplant in 1984. The heart has not caused any problems, but she needed a new liver because the first was damaged by hepatitis.
