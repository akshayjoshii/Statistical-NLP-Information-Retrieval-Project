THE NATIONAL Federation of Fishermen's Organisations is holding an emergency
meeting today on the crisis over fish imports. Fishermen and dock workers at
Grimsby last night mounted a 24-hour blockade to prevent cheap Russian and
Norwegian fish arriving.
The federation has written to Russian and Norwegian fishing organisations
threatening a full-scale land and sea blockade of British ports if the
imports do not stop.
In the last few days, cargoes of Russian and French fish have been turned
back or destroyed at ports around Britain.
