The latest fitness machine to hit Europe from the US is Walkfit, a
non-motorised treadmill with a built-in upper body exerciser.
It has been developed by NordicTrack, the Chaska, Minneapolis-based company
famous for its indoor skiing machines. NordicTrack claims that Walkfit burns
up 70 per cent more calories than a motorised treadmill because the user
provides all the required energy. The Walkfit incorporates two free-moving
bars to be grasped while walking or running, so exercising the upper body.
