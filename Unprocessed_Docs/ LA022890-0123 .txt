Al Mejia of El Toro High School made his coach look good in the second half of Tuesday's Southern Section 3-A semifinal boys' soccer match against Redlands. 
Only two minutes after entering the game, Mejia scored to give El Toro a 1-0 victory over Redlands. 
The Chargers (14-3-2) will make their first appearance in a Southern Section boys' soccer final. They will meet San Gabriel Valley League champion Cerritos Saturday at 8 p.m. at Gahr High School. 
"We play in a tough league with Mission Viejo and Dana Hills," Coach Carlos Arce said, "but Redlands was a very tough team too. They were very physical and forced us to play with discipline. We've faced physical teams before, but no one with as much skill." 
Seventeen minutes into the second half Barry crossed a pass from the right corner and Mejia drilled it past Redlands goalkeeper Jim Moran to give El Toro the only goal it would need. Redlands finished the season 21-5-2. 
El Toro goalkeeper Kevin Rowe, a two-time All-South Coast League selection, recorded eight saves for his second shutout of the playoffs.
