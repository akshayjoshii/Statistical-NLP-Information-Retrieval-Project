'ROBOTIC eyes' can now be made from a photosensitive protein called
bacteriorhodopsin (BR) found in salt-saturated water such as the Dead Sea.
A team from Fuji Photo Film in Japan has developed a retina-like light
sensor which rivals the most sophisticated silicon devices. It mimics some
of the functions of the eye in a simpler, less costly and more compact
package.
The sensor is constructed by wedging a thin film of the protein between two
oxide electrodes in an electrically conductive gel. When light hits the
sensor the BR molecules react by changing shape, generating a quick electric
pulse that travels through the electrode. But if the light remains constant
the protein returns to its original shape. No charge is generated until the
light level changes again.
Potential applications include recognition systems for security purposes and
factory automation.
