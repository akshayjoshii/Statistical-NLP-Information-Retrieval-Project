Recommended: 
"FOUNTAIN"(U.S.S.R.; Director: Yuri Mamin. Cineplex Odeon Fairfax, 9:15 p.m.). Wildly satiric, no-holds-barred, post-perestroika comedy: a Kazakstanian peasant grandfather, put in charge of a Moscow apartment house water pipe room, pulls the whole house into chaos -- with a little help from bureaucracy, inefficiency and social malaise. All are amply ridiculed. (Michael Wilmington) 
"AMERICAN STORIES"(U.S.; D: Chantal Akerman. Cineplex Century Plaza 2, 9:15 p.m.) Bizarre Jewish-American vaudeville from the Belgian art film director of "Toute Une Nuite" -- which, formally, this film resembles. A series of sketches, mostly taken from old ethnic jokes, are done black-out style against outdoor New York City backgrounds. Strange, sometimes stiff, intermittently touching. (Michael Wilmington) 
"CIRCUS BOYS"(Japan; D: Kaizo Hayashi. Century Plaza 2, 7 p.m.) Beautiful black-and-white images, charmingly archaic, adorn this archetypal fable of two boys, good and bad, whose paths cross and diverge in the circus. (Michael Wilmington)
