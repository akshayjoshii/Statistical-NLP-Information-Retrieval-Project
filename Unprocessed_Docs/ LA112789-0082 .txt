OSLO-BOUND: Ronald Jue of Fullerton has visited the Dalai Lama in India and heads the foundation that was sponsoring his Orange County visit when the Dalai Lama received word in October that he'd won the Nobel Peace Prize. . . . Now, when the Dalai Lama receives the prize Dec. 10 in Oslo, Jue will be among the 80 people from around the world on the holy man's guest list. . . . A spokesman for Jue's Newport Beach-based East-West Foundation said Jue will make the trip and will probably meet with the Nobelist in Norway. Dana Parsons and Steve Emmons
