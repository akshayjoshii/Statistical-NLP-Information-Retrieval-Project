Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the biotechnology company, has begun a new round of
trials for its kidney transplant drug, writes Daniel Green.
The trials are the first placebo-controlled in phase II, which is designed
to assess how well the drug works. If they go well, it would be put through
the much larger phase III trials before approval and product launch in 1997.
The drug is being developed with Baxter International, the US healthcare
company.
The drug, code-named LM-CD45, is designed to reduce the chance of a newly
transplanted kidney being rejected by the patient.
'LM-CD45 holds the promise of reducing the frequency of acute rejection,
thereby improving the success rate and cost-effectiveness of the transplant
procedure,' said Mr Don Joseph, president of Baxter's renal division.
Mr Paul Haycock, chief executive, said the company was investigating the use
of the drug to prevent rejection in transplants of other organs.
