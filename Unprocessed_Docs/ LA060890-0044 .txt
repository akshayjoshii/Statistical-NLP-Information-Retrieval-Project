A $100,000 grant -- the largest ever given by the Glendale Community Foundation -- has been awarded to the Salvation Army to help establish the first shelter for homeless families in Glendale. 
The 34-year-old nonprofit group recently allocated the grant toward purchase of the Booth House, a private residence on Chester Street that the Salvation Army plans to convert into a temporary shelter for displaced families. 
The Glendale City Council last month allocated $200,000 in federal grant money for the Booth House. The Salvation Army will use the foundation grant in paying the balance of the $460,000 purchase price at the close of escrow June 26. The shelter is expected to open in September. 
Tom Miller, executive director of the community group, said the foundation typically awards grants of under $10,000. He said the unusually large grant was made at the request of a member who donated his own funds for the shelter. 
Miller said the donor, who asked to remain anonymous, is a longtime trustee of the foundation.
