A 26-year-old San Diego man who was lost overnight in the Cleveland National Forest was rescued Sunday by a sheriff's helicopter crew. 
Fareed Harley Stevenson got separated from two other hikers Saturday evening. The two others found their way out and called Orange County sheriff's officials at about 1 a.m. 
The Sheriff's Department launched a helicopter search at daybreak, and rescuers spotted Stevenson at about 9:30 a.m. in a canyon near San Juan Hot Springs campground. The helicopter landed in a flat area nearby and Stevenson, who was uninjured, hiked to the helicopter and was airlifted out. 
Sheriff's officials said the hikers had not planned to stay overnight and did not have supplies.
