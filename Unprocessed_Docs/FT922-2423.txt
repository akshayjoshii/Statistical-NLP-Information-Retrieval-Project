TYSON Foods, the US fresh foods and poultry group, is to acquire Arctic
Alaska Fisheries in a merger deal valued at more than Dollars 200m, Reuter
reports from Springdale, Arkansas.
Under the terms of the deal, 0.5686 Tyson shares plus Dollars 2.23 cash will
be exchanged for each Arctic Alaska share.
Arctic Alaska said Tyson would issue about 9.47m Class A shares plus about
Dollars 37.2m in cash in the deal, which is valued at Dollars 212.4m, based
on the Dollars 18.50 closing price of Tyson shares on June 15.
Arctic Alaska, which earned Dollars 16.7m in 1991 on revenues of Dollars
225m, operates a fleet of 31 fishing vessels mainly in the 200-mile US
exclusive economic zone off Alaska, Oregon and California. Tyson said it
expected Arctic Alaska to post 1992 revenues of about Dollars 250m.
Arctic Alaska also operates two Seattle-based reprocessing plants as well as
shore-based fish processing plants in Oregon, British Columbia and China. It
also has an Idaho-based aquaculture enterprise and several joint ventures
overseas.
The merger is subject to certain conditions, including approval by
two-thirds of Arctic Alaska shareholders and by regulatory authorities.
Both companies' boards have unanimously approved the deal.
Nabisco Foods Group, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings, has agreed to exchange
its 32 per cent interest in Grupo Gamesa, Mexico's largest biscuit and
cracker company, for five of Gamesa's food and pet food companies and an
undisclosed amount of cash, Reuter reports.
The agreement is with PepsiCo's international snack food division, PepsiCo
Foods International, Gamesa's other owner. As a result, PepsiCo will own 80
per cent of the rest of Gamesa.
Nabisco will receive Gamesa's pasta, confectionery, dry desert mix, nuts and
pet food businesses, plus cash. The agreement returns to Nabisco two of its
well-known cracker trademarks, Ritz and Premium.
Sales of the transferred businesses totalled Dollars 85m in 1991, about 18
per cent of Gamesa's total sales.
