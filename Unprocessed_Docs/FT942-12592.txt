The Dutch and Belgians have tentatively agreed to set up a joint naval
command headquarters to cut costs at a time of shrinking defence budgets, a
Dutch navy spokesman said yesterday. The two nations will merge their
command units at the Dutch naval headquarters in Den Helder, 86 km north of
Amsterdam. Operations will be directed by the headquarters by a single
binational staff. The accord has to be formally approved by defence
ministers of both nations. Belgian navy headquarters in Ostend will be
closed, while there will be a cut in Dutch staff at Den Helder. Belgium
froze its defence budget last year at Dollars 2.85bn a year until 1997. It
is also aiming to halve its armed forces to 47,500 soldiers. After the
restructuring, Belgium will have three frigates, 11 minesweepers and hunters
and two other command vessels. The Dutch defence ministry will be cutting
its number of frigates from 22 to 16, submarines from six to four, and all
its 12 minesweepers will be abolished.
