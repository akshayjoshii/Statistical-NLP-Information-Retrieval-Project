The French National Assembly is to consider a judge's request to strip Lyons
Mayor Michel Noir (left) of his parliamentary immunity for suspected
embezzlement. The request from Judge Philippe Courroye was a further blow to
the mayor of France's second city, once regarded as a possible presidential
contender. Mr Courroye said he wanted to place Mr Noir under judicial
control while he investigates suspicions the mayor used up to FFr7m (Pounds
800,000) in city funds for his own election campaign.
