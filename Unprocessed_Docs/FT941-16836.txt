Allied-Lyons' US offshoot, DCA Food Industries - a supplier of bakery mixes
and bakery production equipment - is acquiring Baker's Aid Co, a division of
M Raubvogel Co.
Baker's Aid, based in Syosset, New York, is a supplier of bakery production
equipment for on-premise bakeries.
The consideration is not material in relation to Allied-Lyons' net assets.
