Oil group BP New Zealand will raise NZDollars 125m (USDollars 70.6m) through
the sale of land in the Hikurangi Forest Estate on the North Island to its
joint venture partner, the forest division of Fletcher Challenge.
BP said the sale followed the group's decision to focus resources and
expertise on its core hydrocarbon business, and withdraw from activities not
directly related to oil and chemicals.
