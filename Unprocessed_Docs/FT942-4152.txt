The underlying rate of US producer price inflation is rising despite a fall
in the 'headline' index in May, official figures indicated yesterday.
Leading economists yesterday predicted that price pressures at the wholesale
level would result in higher consumer price inflation next year.
The Labour Department said 'core' producer prices - which exclude the
volatile food and energy items - rose 0.4 per cent between April and May,
more than most analysts expected. Core producer prices rose at an annual
rate of 3.1 per cent in the first five months of this year, a significant
acceleration when compared with a rise of 0.3 per cent for 1993 as a whole.
The latest consensus forecast, compiled from projections by 52 leading 'blue
chip' forecasters, published yesterday, predicts that consumer price
inflation will rise to 3.3 per cent next year from 2.7 per cent this year.
Last month's prices pressures, however, were masked by large, erratic
declines in the price of food (down 0.9 per cent from April) and energy
(down 1.0 per cent). The overall producer price index thus fell 0.1 per cent
last month following a 0.1 per cent decline in April. Prices were down 0.4
per cent in the year to May.
