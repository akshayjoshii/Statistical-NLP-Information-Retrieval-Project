Police Agent Mark Kling has been selected as one of two officers in the county to receive this year's Los Angeles Community Protectors Award. 
"He has a record of outstanding contributions to the city, both on and off duty," Chief Kenneth G. Hickman wrote in Kling's nomination letter. "This officer sets the example for others to follow." 
The award honors those who are considered the top police officers, firefighters, sheriff's deputies, paramedics and Highway Patrol officers in the county. Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson and county Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich began the award five years ago. 
Kling began his involvement with the department in 1970 as a police Explorer scout. A decade later he was hired first as a reserve officer and then as a full-time officer. Since then, he has been cited on numerous occasions for the high quality of his work. 
Kling will receive his award today during ceremonies in Universal City.
