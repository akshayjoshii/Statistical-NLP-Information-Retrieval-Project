Commercial and residential properties in London's Docklands are letting and
selling faster than at any stage since the late 1980s, the London Docklands
Development Corporation said yesterday.
Some 800,000 sq ft of offices were let during the 12 months to the end of
March, the largest annual total since 1987 and 50 per cent more than the
previous two years combined, Mr Michael Pickard, corporation chairman, said.
Construction of 1,000 homes also is under way in the area after a sharp rise
in private-sector sales. New residential development had virtually ground to
a halt during the previous few years.
Mr Pickard, announcing the publication of the corporation's annual report
yesterday, said: 'The tide has definitely turned and is now running firmly
in London Docklands' favour.'
Almost 500,000 sq ft of offices had been let since January. More than half
of the office space in Canary Wharf, which came out of administrative
receivership last year, was let.
About 5,600 jobs were created last year, taking the total employed in the
8.5 sq miles of Docklands to 55,600. This compares with 27,200 when the
corporation was formed in 1981.
Several factors had encouraged more tenants to choose the area. These
included the opening of the Limehouse Link which had radically improved road
access to the City, the opening of the Docklands Light Railway extension to
Beckton and the start of work on the Jubilee Underground line extension.
Transport to and within the area was now as good as anywhere in London, Mr
Pickard said. The reliability rate of the Docklands Light Railway was 98 per
cent last year. Nonetheless there was still much to be done, he said.
Docklands had more than 5m sq ft of empty offices, representing a vacancy
rate of more than 40 per cent.
Since the corporation was formed in 1981 it has acquired 1,146 acres of land
for development. Of this 738 acres have been sold to developers, leaving 408
acres to be developed.
The corporation is due gradually to hand over its responsibilities to local
authorities prior to being wound up in March 1998.
