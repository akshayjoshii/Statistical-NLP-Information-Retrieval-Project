THE flashing yellow Belisha beacon introduced by UK transport minister
Leslie Hore-Belisha in the 1930s has become camouflaged in the high street
by improved street lighting, brighter shop fronts and a multitude of
advertising hoardings.
To help drivers spot the beacons more easily, Geo Safety Products, of
Wokingham, together with ICI Acrylics, of Darwin, Lancashire, have developed
a more visible yellow dome to sit on top of the installed poles and bulbs.
The dome uses a luminous pigment which converts the light produced from the
60-watt bulb from the red end of the spectrum to the yellow/green end,
making it more visible to the human eye. In addition, the plastic dome
reflects the sun's ultra-violet light back as visible light during the
daytime, while at night a diamond pattern inside the dome refracts the light
for increased visibility. Geo Safety Products: UK, 0734 770473.
