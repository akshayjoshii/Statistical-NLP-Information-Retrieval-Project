CENTRAL Capital, the troubled Canadian financial services group trying to
sell its core trust unit, has applied for protection under the federal
Companies Creditors Arrangement Act.
A hearing was due in an Ontario Court later today.
The company is seeking protection from creditors while it tries to complete
a restructuring to settle debts of CDollars 1.7bn (USDollars 1.41bn).
