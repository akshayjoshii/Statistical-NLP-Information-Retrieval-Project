Don Slaught, the third free agent to re-sign with the Pittsburgh Pirates, agreed to a three-year contract that will pay him about $3 million -- about $150,000 more a season than the National League's most valuable player, Barry Bonds, made with the Pirates last season. Slaught hit .300 in 84 games with four home runs and 29 runs batted in while platooning with Mike LaValliere.
