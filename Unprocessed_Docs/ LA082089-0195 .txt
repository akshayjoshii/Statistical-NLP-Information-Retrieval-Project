United Humanitarians of Orange County is extremely concerned about a recent development in our county regarding lost pets. The cities of Westminster and Costa Mesa are no longer contracting with the county's animal shelter in Orange, effective July 1, 1989. Because cats and dogs often cross the borders between cities, this also affects the many cities bordering on Westminster and Costa Mesa. This change means that owners of lost pets now need to look at two or three different facilities. 
If you live in or near Westminster and are missing or have found a pet, please call Westminster Animal Control at (714) 898-3311, between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., seven days a week. 
You should also look for your pet at the Orange County Humane Society, 21632 Newland St., Huntington Beach, or call (714) 536-8480. This is a private veterinarian's facility that Westminster now contracts with for animal shelter services. I also suggest that you call Seal Beach Animal Control at (213) 431-2541. 
If you live in or near Costa Mesa and are missing or have found a pet, you should call Costa Mesa Animal Control at (714) 754-5311. Costa Mesa pets are taken to the Bayshore Animal Hospital, 2077 Harbor Blvd., Costa Mesa. The phone number is (714) 646-3800. Westminster and Costa Mesa residents, and those of their bordering cities, should be sure to look at the above facilities in addition to the county animal shelter at 561 The City Drive, Orange. 
Unfortunately, this change will undoubtedly cause the killing of many pets while owners are looking at one facility and their pets are being housed or killed in another. An owner's identification tag should always be on your dog or cat. For one month, UHOC is offering readers a superior Formica ID tag at our cost. Send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to UHOC, 8921 Blackheath Circle, Westminster, Calif. 92683, and we will mail you an order blank immediately.
