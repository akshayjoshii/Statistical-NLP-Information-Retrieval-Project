Jean-Paul Parayre, former vice president of Groupe Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez,
the large French water and construction group, has been appointed a
non-executive director of Tarmac, one of Britain's biggest construction
groups.
Parayre, 57, who at one stage headed Transmanche Link, the Anglo French
construction consortium which designed and built the Channel tunnel, is
based in France and is expected to help Tarmac strengthen its growing
operations in the country.
Tarmac, a founder member of Transmanche, says Parayre, who spent 12 years in
the French civil service before joining Peugot where he organised the
takeover of Chrysler Europe, has valuable experience of French government
and industry.
