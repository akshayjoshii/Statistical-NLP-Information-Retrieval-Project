Smoking Verdict Upheld: A Mississippi judge affirmed the controversial verdict in Horton vs. 
American Tobacco, a key smoker death case. Jurors last month found American liable for the lung cancer death of Nathan Horton, but awarded zero damages to his family. Tobacco lawyers asked Mississippi Circuit Judge Eugene Bogen to rule that American wasn't liable; plaintiff attorneys asked him to award damages or set a new trial on damages alone. Bogen refused to alter the result.
