Red Cross Relief Show Canceled: Promoters have called off one of two planned disaster-relief concerts sponsored by the American Red Cross because they could not line up performers in time for the scheduled Dec. 17 event in the Charlotte (N.C.) Coliseum. But the second concert, to be held the same night in Los Angeles at the Universal Amphitheatre, will go on as planned. Confirmed for the Los Angeles show are Bruce Hornsby & the Range, Natalie Cole, former Police guitarist Andy Summers and Paul Stanley of the rock group Kiss. DANIEL CERONE
