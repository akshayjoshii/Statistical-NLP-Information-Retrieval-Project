Tarmac, the construction group, yesterday announced plans for a Dollars 100m
(Pounds 68.4m) investment and reorganisation of its US businesses which it
estimates could reduce the division's overheads by a fifth.
It forms part of a group-wide efficiency drive launched by Mr Neville Simms,
chief executive, who has already substantially reduced costs in the UK
housing division.
The three year programme will include a Dollars 20m investment to overhaul
the group's Pennsuco quarry near Miami. The company will also be improving
its fleet of ready-mix concrete lorries.
In addition Tarmac is reorganising its US management which previously had
operated as separate regions into three product based businesses: aggregates
and cement, ready-mix concrete and concrete products.
Construction activity, particularly housebuilding, has been recovering in
the US, although building activity in the first few months of this year has
been restricted by bad winter weather.
Nonetheless, building material companies are expecting to see further
recovery in earnings during 1994.
