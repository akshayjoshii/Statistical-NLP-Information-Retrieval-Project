Biochem Pharma, one of Canada's largest biotechnology companies, is taking a
drug it is developing with Glaxo, Europe's biggest pharmaceutical company,
into the last stage of clinical trials, writes Daniel Green.
Trials so far have shown Lamivudine to be far superior to existing
treatments for hepatitis B, said Dr Francesco Bellini, president of the
Montreal company which is hoping to launch the drug in 1997.
The deal with Glaxo gives the UK company marketing rights outside north
America, with a joint venture operating in Canada and Biochem selling alone
in the US.
