A SUB-COMMITTEE of the Indian Coffee Board is inquiring into an allegation
that Nestle India, an important presence in the country's domestic and
export trade in coffee, has diverted a portion of the coffee bought in
export auctions into the domestic market, writes Kunal Bose.
While the company maintains that no diversion of coffee meant for export has
been made to the domestic market, the sub-committee, which is unsatisfied
with the returns submitted by Nestle for purchases made at export auctions
between October 14 1992 and June 9 1993, thinks there is reason to debar it
from participating in future export auctions.
The commerce ministry does not, however, favour the idea of keeping Nestle
out of the export auctions. Its main concern is to step up exports as the
country heads for a bumper coffee crop in 1993-94.
