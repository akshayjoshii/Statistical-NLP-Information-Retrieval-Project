LABOUR'S National Executive Committee yesterday agreed unanimously to repay
Pounds 11,000 donated by a Greek Cypriot businessman at the centre of a
fraud investigation.
The cash, donated by Mr Charilaos Costa, a clothing manufacturer, will be
immediately withdrawn from Labour's account and put aside while receivers
for Mr Costa's business are contacted.
The NEC also yesterday approved plans for all-women shortlists for the
selection of candidates in half the constituencies where the sitting Labour
MP is retiring or where there is a good chance of defeating another party.
