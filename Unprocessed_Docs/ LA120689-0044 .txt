President Bush signed legislation Tuesday designating 733,400 acres of protected wilderness in Nevada and opening 2.4 million more acres to multiple use under the management of the Agriculture Department. 
The measure creates 13 new wilderness areas in Nevada and adds to one other existing area. That would put 2% of the state's land under wilderness protection, preventing development and such uses as timber harvesting, mineral exploration or intrusion by campers in vehicles.
