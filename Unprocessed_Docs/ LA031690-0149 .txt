Mater Dei High School basketball Coach Gary McKnight is suffering from severe muscle spasms in his back, but he said Thursday he would not miss his team's state championship game against San Francisco Riordan Saturday night in Oakland. 
McKnight injured his back lifting a bag of baseball equipment after his son's Little League game Monday night. 
Assistants Dave Taylor and Phil Bellomo have conducted practices this week in McKnight's absence, but McKnight said he plans to go to Oakland. 
"I would never miss the game, even if they have to prop me up," he said.
