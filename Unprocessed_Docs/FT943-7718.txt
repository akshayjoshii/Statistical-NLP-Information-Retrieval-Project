Taiwan has approved proposals for 31 investment projects in China totalling
Dollars 60m (Pounds 38.9m) and will further relax restrictions on investment
by local companies in China, the Economics Ministry said at the weekend.
The moves signify a further step in the liberalisation of investment by
listed Taiwanese companies across the Taiwan Strait, until recently subject
to strict government controls. Small companies have been investing in China
since the early 1980s, largely through indirect channels.
Taiwan has banned direct trade, investment and transport links with China
since 1949, forcing the bulk of such activities to be routed through Hong
Kong.
The recently approved investments by Taiwanese companies include a Dollars
6m container terminal project by Evergreen Marine, part of the Evergreen,
one of the world's biggest container shipping lines. The project marks
Evergreen's first foray into China following an announcement in May it
planned investments amounting to Dollars 80m.
A total of 633 items will be moved from a prohibited list and to a permitted
investment list for Taiwanese manufacturers, the Economics Ministry said.
The newly approved list includes 196 textile items, 188 machinery items and
eight steel-related items.
The combined export value of the 633 items was Dollars 22.6bn in 1993,
accounting for 27 per cent of Taiwan's total exports, the ministry said.
Imports of the items amounted to Dollars 6.14bn or 8 per cent of the total.
A fourth typhoon in two months pounded Taiwan yesterday on leaving three
people dead and two missing, Reuter adds from Taipei.
Typhoon Fred brought 180mm of rain across northern Taiwan overnight and
early on Sunday, and as much as 480mm in mountain districts, days after
torrential rains from Typhoon Doug caused floods in the southern city of
Kaohsiung.
Most domestic flights and many trains were cancelled as the storm, with
winds of up to 180kph, swept across the north of the island.
