China today refused to rule out a trial and further punishment for Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted as Communist Party chief for opposing the military crackdown that crushed pro-democracy demonstrators. 
"His problem is still being investigated," government spokesman Yuan Mu said at the first news conference by a high-ranking official since troops on June 3-4 marched on Tian An Men Square and attacked unarmed demonstrators. 
When the party Central Committee ousted him as secretary general on June 24, it accused Zhao of supporting the protesters and splitting the party, and said his case would be dealt with internally. Since then, however, official criticism has escalated, fueling speculation Zhao may stand trial. 
Collaboration Alleged 
One major government report last week accused Zhao's aides of collaborating with protest leaders accused of trying to overthrow the government. It stopped short of also accusing Zhao of plotting a coup. 
Yuan stressed that the party charges and decision to treat Zhao's case as an internal disciplinary matter are not final. 
"How the problem will finally be dealt with will be decided according to the findings of the investigation," he told more than 100 Chinese and foreign reporters. 
Also today, authorities deported two reporters -- one American and one Taiwanese -- and gave a second Taiwanese reporter 48 hours to leave. All are accused of violating martial law bans on reporting activity. They bring to nine the number of reporters ordered to leave China since June 4. 
The deported American is Mark Hopkins, a reporter for the U.S. government-run Voice of America.
