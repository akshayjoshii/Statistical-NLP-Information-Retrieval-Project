Jacques Attali, late of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, has resurfaced in print hitting back at what he calls the 'man
hunt' that led to his resignation last spring.
Buried in a book confusingly entitled Europe(s) lurks a most promising
sentence: 'Without doubt, I committed errors.' But far from providing fresh
insights into the Fall of Attali, the author continues: 'I know them (the
errors) better than anyone and will not dwell on them.'
