Tough luck for Manchester that Olympic supremo Juan Antonio Samaranch should
arrive in town the morning after the coldest July night since 1946. Even
worse that it soon started raining. However, Manchester has learnt how to
turn bad news into good in its long campaign to win the games in 2000. It
didn't take long for a local worthy to note that since the International
Olympic Committee is really interested in seeing new world records,
yesterday's weather was ideal for any athlete, other than a sprinter,
contemplating a record-breaking run.
