Germany crushed eight times Olympic champions India 3-0 with devastating
corner drills yesterday to launch a drive for gold in the men's hockey
tournament.
'We had very good short corners. We were awarded three and scored from each
of them,' coach Paul Lissek said. 'That was the success of this match.'
However, he said his team had made too many errors.
In other opening matches, Britain overcame Egypt to win by 2-0 and Australia
won 7-0 against Argentina.
Spain swept past New Zealand 3-0, delighting a local crowd, including
International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch, in
Terrassa, outside Barcelona.
