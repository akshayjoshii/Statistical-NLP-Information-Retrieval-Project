Mr Lien Chan, Taiwan's prime minister, has arrived in Mexico City in a
surprise diversion from a tour of Central America and the US, the first
visit by a senior Taiwanese official to Mexico in 23 years.
The two countries do not maintain official diplomatic relations, having
severed ties in the early 1970s following the United Nations' recognition of
Beijing.
To avoid protests from China, which could have scuttled the visit, Mr Lien's
change in plan was announced in Guatemala just minutes before he stepped on
an aircraft, ostensibly bound for New York.
The trip was another instance of the Taiwanese government's policy of
'pragmatic diplomacy'.
Using a similar formula, President Lee Teng-hui took a 'vacation' tour to
south-east Asian countries in April, during which he played golf with top
officials, sparking vociferous complaints from China.
The premier's visit to Mexico was billed as a bid to boost trade and
investment ties, with a view toward exploiting Mexico's low labour and land
costs and preferential access to US and Canadian markets through the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
Local media reported that Mr Lien was to meet President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
The visit coincides with a growing wariness in Taiwan about investing in
China and rising anti-Chinese sentiment in Indonesia and elsewhere in
south-east Asia where Taiwanese businesses have made heavy investments in
recent years.
Analysts in Taipei said that Taiwan may seek support from Mexico for its
application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Taiwan is also working to build international support for a bid to rejoin
the UN, which it hopes to bring before the general assembly in the autumn.
Taiwan has formal ties with just 29 states.
