The Budget is set to make the leap from battered despatch box to information
superhighway.
Scarcely will Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, have sat down after
delivering his speech on November 29 than the full text of his remarks will
be ready to speed round the globe courtesy of the Internet, symbol of the
wired society.
The Internet, a semi-official, self-regulating system of networks which
connects about 7,000 databases and 2m computers, is emerging as the de facto
information superhighway.
Up to 25m people worldwide will be able to tap into Treasury computers,
examine the chancellor's arguments in detail and download paragraphs that
interest them. Most Internet users are in the US, but more than 1m Britons
now have the computer, modem and software which guarantees them access to
the world's largest computer network.
The Treasury was vague about the number of people who might benefit from
access to Mr Clarke's words at the speed of light. But it thought some
Internet users were academics, researchers or accountants with an interest
in UK fiscal policy.
The Budget on the Internet is one of the first consequences of a Treasury
plan to use the latest technology to promote more open government.
The Treasury intends to publish news releases, ministers' speeches, minutes
of the chancellor's monthly meeting with the governor of the Bank of England
and reports from the panel of independent forecasters (the 'Wise Men') on
the Internet as a first step towards more comprehensive public exposure.
The service will be free of charge and available to anybody with Internet
access.*
The chancellor will not be able to follow suit. He has access to the
Internet neither at home nor at the office.
The Daily Telegraph launched an electronic version of its newspaper
yesterday. The Electronic Telegraph is available on the Internet from 7am
every day.
