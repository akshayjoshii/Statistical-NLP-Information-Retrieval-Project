BRITISH Railways Board is being prosecuted by the Health and Safety
Executive over a rail accident near Leeds last summer in which 25 people
were injured. The case is due to be heard on Monday morning before Leeds
magistrates.
The new prosecution follows an investigation by the HSE's railway
inspectorate into the Leeds crash, when a train from London's Kings Cross
was diverted into the path of another train during emergency signalling
procedures.
