DIPLOMATIC activity aimed at preventing a showdown over North Korea's
suspected development of nuclear weapons has accelerated with Pyongyang
yesterday proposing talks with South Korea, while the US agreed to hold
discussions on the issue with North Korea next week.
The flurry of negotiations comes shortly before the June 12 deadline when
North Korea is scheduled to withdraw formally from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty (NPT), which would halt inspections of its nuclear
facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The US and South Korea hope to persuade North Korea to remain a signatory of
the treaty.
The US-North Korean talks, which are scheduled for June 2 in New York, are
considered crucial in solving the crisis.
The high-level discussions will involve Mr Robert Gallucci, the US assistant
secretary of state for political-military affairs, and Mr Kang Sok Chu, the
first vice foreign minister of North Korea. North Korea is believed to be
seeking improved ties with the US in exchange for returning to the NPT,
according to officials in Seoul.
North Korea cited an alleged threat from the US in justifying its withdrawal
from the treaty, including the holding of US military exercises in South
Korea.
It also claimed that special inspections demanded by the IAEA of two nuclear
facilities would provide important military information to the US.
Some analysts believe that North Korea decided to withdraw from the NPT in a
desperate attempt to gain US diplomatic recognition, which Pyongyang would
regard as a guarantee of its independence.
South Korea said it had no objections to the establishment of diplomatic
relations between Washington and Pyongyang.
North Korea also offered yesterday to resume talks with South Korea on May
31 in what was considered a conciliatory gesture.
The proposal was in response to a similar suggestion made by Seoul last
week.
