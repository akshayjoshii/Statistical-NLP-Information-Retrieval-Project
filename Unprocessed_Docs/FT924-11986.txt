WOMEN WILL have to wait longer before they can receive a state pension, if
the government accepts recent proposals.
The Social Security Advisory Committee dropped a bombshell when, in evidence
to the government's inquiry into the equalisation of state pension ages, it
re-commended that women receive the state pension at age 65, the present age
for men, instead of at 60.
The committee admitted that its reasons were financial - the estimated
Pounds 3bn saved each year by making women wait for their pension could be
spent on raising the social security benefits paid to the poorer sections of
the community.
It is a solution which accepts that the resources available for social
security are finite. One lesson from the last general election was that,
while people supported the proposals for higher benefits, they were not
prepared to pay for them through higher taxes or higher National Insurance
contributions.
But pensions and retirement are not related solely to financial
considerations. Employment policy and social trends also have an impact on
attitudes.
Over the past decade, men have been ceasing work well before state pension
age. The 1991 labour-force survey, published in the Employment Gazette of
April 1992, showed that more men are stopping working before age 65, even
though they do not receive a retirement pension from the state until they
reach age 65.
There are two main reasons for this. Employers, when reducing their
workforce, have tended to make older employees redundant; while many
employees want to cease working before age 65, either because they have had
enough of work or because they want to do something different while they are
still young enough.
The present employment pattern is different among women. The number working
beyond age 60 is comparatively small, but it is growing. The Department of
Employment does not expect these numbers to increase significantly, but its
predictions are based on the present pension ages.
Taken together, the figures show that only two out of three people are
working beyond age 55, so that one may safely assume that large numbers of
men and women will cease work well before reaching 65.
Although Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has given no
indication of the government's likely action, it is expected that it will
raise the women's pension age to 65, with a suitable run-in period, despite
the trend towards earlier retirement. If this does happen, what can
employees, both men and women, do to ensure that they have an income if they
cease work before age 65?
There are two courses. The first and more practical is to look to the
private sector, either through an occupational pension scheme or by making
arrangements for a personal pension.
Many occupations, such as banking, insurance and the Civil Service, have
traditionally retired their employees at 60. Several other schemes now have
a common pension age below 65 for both sexes.
Where such schemes integrate their benefits with the state basic pension, it
is common for them to pay men an additional bridging pension from retirement
until age 65, to replace the single person's state pension. So if the
government does equalise at age 65, occupational schemes with integrated
benefits will be under pressure to pay bridging pensions to both men and
women until age 65.
However, the latest survey from the National Association of Pension Funds
shows that more occupational schemes are setting their common pension age at
65. These could come under pressure from employees to provide generous
early-retirement benefits, together with bridging pensions.
Employees in occupational schemes would need to consider making further
savings provision themselves, such as additional voluntary contributions
(AVCs) and personal equity plans (Peps).
A move to equalise pension ages at 65 would send a signal to employees who
are not in occupational schemes that they cannot rely on the state for their
pension if they stop working early. They would need to make their own
provision through personal pensions, which allow individuals to take
benefits from age 50.
However, employees will need to make substantial contributions in order to
secure worthwhile early-retirement pensions, because there will be less time
to build up a substantial fund, and annuity rates are lower at an early age.
The second approach, favoured by many in the pensions industry, is to press
for a system of flexible retirement - that is, employees would be able to
retire at a convenient time over a period, such as between ages 60 and 70.
This looks attractive on paper, but there are a number of flaws, such as who
would decide when the time is convenient - the employee or the employer?
So long as entitlement to the state pension depends only on employees
reaching a certain age, not on whether they have ceased work, most will take
the pension at the earliest possible age, even though they may still be
working.
Employees can currently defer taking the state pension for up to five years,
receiving an enhancement when it is eventually taken. Few take up this
option, even when they continue working. And this would be likely to happen
with a flexible pension age, thereby negating any flexibility, unless
entitlement to the pension also required employees to cease paid employment. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
