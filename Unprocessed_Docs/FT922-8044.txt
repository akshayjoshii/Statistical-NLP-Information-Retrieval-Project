BECTU, THE broadcasting union, forecast that BBC news and sports programmes
might be disrupted today by industrial action called to protest against
Producer Choice.
Mr Tony Lennon, Bectu president, said: 'The management will have difficulty
maintaining a service.'
Producer Choice is the BBC policy of giving producers the right to chose the
services they need - everything from camera crews, to makeup and studios -
in the outside market. The union fears thousands of jobs will be lost as a
result.
The strike will last for eight hours, from noon today.
