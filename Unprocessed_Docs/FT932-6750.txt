TELEVISION and newspaper advertising dipped in the final quarter of last
year but it is predicted to rally this year, a report published yesterday by
the Advertising Association says.
Revenue from press advertising in the final three months of last year was
6.4 per cent lower than during the same period the previous year when
adjusted for inflation. The final quarter figure was also down on the year's
previous quarters, which had each seen average falls of 2 per cent measured
year on year.
Television advertising revenue fell by 4.8 per cent in the last quarter of
1992.
The Advertising Association says television advertising will now lead the
sector out of its decline, and predicts that as the economy comes out of
recession overall advertising revenues will grow by 2 per cent in real terms
this year, and by 6 per cent next year.
