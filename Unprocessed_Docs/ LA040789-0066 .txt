From Overseas: West German film director Wim Wenders will replace American Francis Coppola as president of the Cannes Film Festival jury May 11-23. Coppola changed his plans because of "professional commitments." Wenders won the festival's Golden Palm Award for best film in 1984 for "Paris, Texas." . . . In Rome, Gina Lollobrigida, Nino Manfredi, Raf Vallone and other Italian screen stars have launched a campaign to reduce the growing number of foreign actors used in Italian films. "We have to defend ourselves, they do it in other countries, why not here?" Lollobrigida said at a meeting of the Union of Italian Actors. Italian directors often dub actors' voices after the film is shot, making it easy to use foreign actors. "The difference between a foreign actor who comes to Italy and the Italian actor who goes abroad is that the Italian must speak the language of that country," Vallone said. ALEENE MacMINN
