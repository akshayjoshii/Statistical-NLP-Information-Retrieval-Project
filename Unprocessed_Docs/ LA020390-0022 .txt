Lawyers for an AIDS-afflicted doctor suing New York City for negligence asserted that they had proved a city hospital was careless in disposing of infectious wastes. Dr. Veronica Prego claims that she contracted the disease from a needle left carelessly at Kings County Hospital. A professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business testified that Prego could have made up to $30 million in her normal estimated working lifetime of 32.8 years had she not become infected.
