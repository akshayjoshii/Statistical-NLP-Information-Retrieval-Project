THE Medical Research Council (MRC) and Wellcome Trust are joining forces to
set up a genetic research centre in Cambridge.
The centre, which will have a budget of several million pounds a year, will
extend a research project led by Dr John Sulston of the MRC Laboratory of
Molecular Biology in Cambridge.
Early this year Dr Sulston was considering an offer to join a genetics
company in the US - a prospect that dismayed British genetic researchers -
but the prospect of new funding has persuaded him to stay in the UK.
Dr Sulston is working out the genome - the entire genetic blueprint  - of
the nematode worm C. elegans, which provides a simplified model of the human
genome.
The centre will continue the worm genome project and begin to apply its
lessons to the much larger task of finding the sequence of chemical
'letters' in the 100,000 human genes. Several sites in Cambridge are being
considered for it.
The research will have strong international links, especially with the US,
France and Japan.
The Wellcome Trust is the world's largest medical charity, with a budget of
more than Pounds 100m a year - half as much as the state-funded MRC -
derived mainly from its majority stake in the Wellcome drug company.
