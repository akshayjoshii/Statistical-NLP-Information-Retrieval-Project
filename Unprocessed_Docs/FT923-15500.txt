AIR TRAFFIC growth in May was less than expected, the International Air
Transport Association said yesterday, writes Daniel Green. Passenger traffic
on international scheduled services of Iata's 207 airlines rose 17 per cent
in May, compared with May 1991, when traffic was depressed by the Gulf war.
The improvement on 1990 was only 10 per cent.
