Two armed-robbery defendants are responsible for the 1988 murder of an Inglewood police sergeant even though they are not charged with pulling the trigger, the prosecuting attorney argued in Torrance Superior Court on Friday. 
Joevone Elster, 23, and Van Otis Wilson, 22, both of Los Angeles, face 25 years to life for first-degree murder and robbery charges in the March 31, 1988, shooting death of Inglewood Police Sgt. George Aguilar. 
Police say the bullet that killed Aguilar -- the first Inglewood police officer to be murdered in the line of duty in the department's 81-year history -- was fired by Leslie Holget, also of Los Angeles. Police say Holget died after shooting himself at the end of a 45-mile chase that led police to Newhall. 
A 15-year veteran who worked as an undercover narcotics officer, Aguilar was shot while in a high-speed chase of suspects in the armed robbery of a Los Angeles gas station money courier. 
Four defendants -- including Elster and Wilson -- were charged with robbing Masih Modani, the courier, of about $2,000. Because Aguilar was killed while investigating the robbery, all four defendants faced murder charges. 
One of the defendants, a 15-year-old, has been found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to the California Youth Authority until he is 25. Patrick Anthony Carr has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and agreed to testify in the trial of Elster and Wilson. He is awaiting sentencing.
