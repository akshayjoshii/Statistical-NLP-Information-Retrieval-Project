Rail traffic along one of Poland's main international railway routes was
badly disrupted yesterday after a rail crash, which killed three people when
a train smashed into their car in eastern Poland.
Meanwhile, 75 people were injured, 11 critically, when two trains travelling
between Kafr el-Sheikh and Biyala collided head-on in the Nile Delta region
yesterday.
