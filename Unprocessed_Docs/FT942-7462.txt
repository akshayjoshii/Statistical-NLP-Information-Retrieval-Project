Rogers Cablesystems, Canada's biggest cable-TV operator, is to co-operate
with Microsoft to install the US software group's new interactive television
software, known as Tiger.
Tiger is one of several competing software systems being developed, which
will deliver video-on-demand, shopping, education and other services to
cable-TV subscribers.
Rogers has signed a letter of intent to license the Tiger system, and take
part in early testing of Microsoft's operating system for interactive
broadband cable networks. TCI, the biggest US cable-TV operator, has signed
a similar deal with Microsoft.
Rogers said it was attracted to the Microsoft system by its open
architecture and cost. Microsoft claims Tiger can deliver interactive
programming for about a tenth of the cost of rival technologies.
The system is based on personal-computer technology rather than mainframes.
Microsoft's rivals doubt whether PC-type hardware can provide the
communications and processing power for a network of cable-TV subscribers.
