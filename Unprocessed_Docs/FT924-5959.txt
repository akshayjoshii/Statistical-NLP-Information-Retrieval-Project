Who says Her Majesty's government has run out of ideas? Treasury minister
Stephen Dorrell, one of the Tories' brighter young things, is begging for
inspiration.
'I want to issue a clear and open invitation for ideas on how we can best go
forward, from financiers, builders, and anybody else with a worth-
while scheme to offer,' the 40-year old minister said in a speech on
privatisation to the Centre for Policy Studies.
This may be just another sign of the Treasury's recent abrupt U-turn on
listening to outsiders. Certainly it ought to help deflect the blame the
next time a Treasury idea goes horribly wrong. No doubt ministers would also
welcome worthwhile advice on how to make a success of the EC presidency, how
to bring about some green economic shoots, how to make the council tax
popular in the south-east etc.
Ideas on a postcard please to S J Dorrell, c/o of HM Treasury, Parliament
Street, London SW1P 3AG.
