MASTERCARD, the US credit card company, yesterday said it had filed a
lawsuit in a New York federal court accusing American Express of using
'false and misleading' advertising to promote its American Express corporate
credit card.
The MasterCard legal action, which seeks to block three American Express
advertisements, also seeks financial damages.
MasterCard alleged in its court action that American Express was not telling
the truth in one advertisement in which it claimed its corporate card was
superior to other cards because there were no late fees or other charges.
American Express, according to the suit, does assess penalties for overdue
payments.
Ms Christine Levite of American Express yesterday claimed there was no merit
to the lawsuit.
Mr Parker Bagley, a lawyer for MasterCard, said the suit was filed after
American Express declined a request to withdraw the offending
advertisements.
General Motors, which has issued more than 5m MasterCard-based GM credit
cards since launching the non-bank card last September, yesterday said it
was launching a Visa-based GM card in the Canadian market. The card will be
issued under an agreement between GM of Canada and Toronto Dominion Bank.
