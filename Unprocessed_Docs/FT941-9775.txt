Britain's most highly-paid National Health Service doctors earn an extra
Pounds 400,000 a year from private practice, a Monopolies and Mergers
Commission report showed yesterday.
A survey conducted for an MMC inquiry into private medical services showed
that these pre-tax earnings were achieved in 1992 by an elite group of about
40 consultants through treating private patients. The income was in addition
to their NHS salaries, which ranged from Pounds 37,905 to Pounds 48,945 in
1992-93.
Some 35 per cent of consultants also received distinction awards of between
Pounds 9,935 and Pounds 47,200.
The government yesterday accepted an MMC recommendation that the British
Medical Association should be prohibited from publishing guidelines on fees
for undertaking private practice. Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs
minister, said consultants following the guidelines were able to 'charge
higher fees than would otherwise be possible'.
The Pounds 400,000-plus consultants were only 0.3 per cent of all doctors
earning more than Pounds 1,000 a year from private work. The MMC report
revealed another similar-sized group that earned more than Pounds 300,000 in
1992.
Plastic surgeons were shown as the specialist group with the highest private
earnings, with typical incomes ranging between Pounds 50,000 and Pounds
75,000 gross.
The MMC says consultants' earnings from private practice are estimated to
have risen almost eightfold between 1980 and 1992, from Pounds 74m to Pounds
570m.
The report estimates that consultants' median pre-tax earnings in 1992 were
Pounds 42,000 from the NHS and Pounds 17,000 from private practice. But
about 6,000 NHS consultants undertook no private work at all, while a
further 2,000 senior doctors earned less than Pounds 1,000 from it.
Full-time NHS consultants should not earn more than 10 per cent of their
salaries from private practice, but there is no limit for part-time
consultants.
Consultants typically spend 50 hours a week on NHS duties.
