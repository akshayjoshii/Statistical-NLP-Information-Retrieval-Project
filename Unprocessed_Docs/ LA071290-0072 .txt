A hearing has been set for Sept. 28 on an appeal by Park Labrea management of the city's rejection of a proposed charge of more than $3 million to tenants for the cost of fencing and gating the 10,000-resident apartment complex. 
"The appellant has claimed that there was departmental error, abuse of discretion, and that there is new evidence or information to present which was not previously available," said a notice sent by the Rent Stabilization Division of the city's Community Development Department. 
The hearing will be held at 9 a.m. at the Rent Adjustment Commission's eighth-floor hearing room, at 215 W. 6th St. 
The Rent Stabilization Division, in its decision handed down in May, found that Forest City Management Co. did not provide enough information to justify the proposed rent increases, and that the fencing and gating system was not yet operating when the application was filed. 
Forest City, which operates Park Labrea and owns a half-interest in the 4,200-unit complex, submitted its application for a rent hike on Sept. 25 of last year, hoping to be allowed to charge tenants $12.09 a month in perpetuity to defray the cost of the $3,054,588 security system.
