MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday produced his
expected shake-up of his department's export promotion activities, which
cost the taxpayer Pounds 170m a year.
The main change is the separation of export promotion from trade policy in
the Department of Trade and Industry. Previously, individual civil servants
had responsibility for promoting exports and dealing with trade issues such
as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Those tasks will be
separated, with an extra 60 officials assigned to promoting exports.
Mr Heseltine said: 'It has become increasingly clear to me that we have to
sharpen the focus of our export promotion effort and extend its coverage.'
Responsibility for bilateral trade would be brought together in a separate
new division.
A new post of director-general of export promotion has been created. It will
be filled by Mr Ray Mingay, at present the UK consul in Chicago. He will
work with the Foreign Office and up to 100 businessmen seconded from the
private sector to help with export promotion. About 28 have been seconded to
date.
In addition, export strategies are to be drawn up for the UK's top 80 export
markets. At present the list extends only to the top 50.
Export promotion will be split into two divisions, one covering Europe and
the Americas and the other the Asia Pacific region, including the Middle
East and Africa.
