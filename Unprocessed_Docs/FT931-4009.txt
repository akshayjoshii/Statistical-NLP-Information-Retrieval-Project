BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), the Australian resources group, yesterday
moved to tighten its management grip on Foster's Brewing, the Australian
beermaker which it controls, with a management restructuring, writes Bruce
Jacques.
Mr Tony Larkin, former general manager for finance at BHP Minerals, has been
appointed finance director at Foster's. Mr Peter Jonson, the former finance
chief at Foster's, has resigned. Foster's board, which already includes four
BHP nominees, said the group head office would be divided into three units:
corporate affairs, corporate finance and corporate strategy.
