There are not many movies that get a round of applause even before they start, but "The Godfather Part III" pulled that extraordinary feat as the curtain went up in Los Angeles on its first public showing. 
In even better news for Paramount Pictures, which has invested at least $58 million in the highly anticipated sequel, the Wednesday screening produced robust applause as the final credits rolled. 
"Without question, this is the one everybody's talking about," said John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. "Ever since 'Dick Tracy,' all the talk has been about 'Godfather.' " 
Michael Medved, a reviewer for the television show "Sneak Previews," called the movie "impressive. If there was a Medved scale, it would be about a nine." 
The film will open Christmas Day on 1,800 screens in the United States and Canada.
