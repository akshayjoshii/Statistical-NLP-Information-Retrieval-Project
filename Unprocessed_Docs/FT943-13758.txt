The Bundesbank's policy-making council meets on Thursday, the last time
before the German central bank's summer recess. As is traditional, the
meeting is the occasion for the Bundesbank's mid-year review of the
development of M3 money supply - this year is especially important in view
of ballooning growth in M3 since late 1993.
A dilemma for the Bundesbank has been how to justify cutting interest rates
while tolerating monetary growth at more than double the 4 to 6 per cent
target range. The Bundesbank is likely to modify the target range on
Thursday, but there is little consensus among economists about how this may
be achieved.
Traders will be less interested in the technicalities than concrete signs
that the Bundesbank will be able to resume interest rate cuts in the autumn
without further damage to its credibility.
In this context a 'good' figure for June M3, likely to be released on
Thursday, would provide evidence that money growth is subsiding. Anything
under 12 per cent would be considered 'good' as it would mean a decline from
May's 13.4 per cent annualised, seasonally adjusted rate.
There is a chance that the Bundesbank will cut the discount rate on
Thursday, but this is highly unlikely.
