LONDON'S RiverBus, the loss-making Thames passenger service due to close at
midnight last night, has won a three-month stay of execution, Richard
Tomkins writes.
A consortium of public and private-sector bodies, mostly with interests in
the Docklands area of east London, has raised Pounds 300,000 to keep the
service going while efforts are made to secure its long-term future.
The service had looked doomed to closure after the financial collapse of
Olympia & York's Canary Wharf development in Docklands, which had subsidised
it.
The administrators to Canary Wharf have now agreed to pay half the cost of
underwriting the RiverBus's Pounds 100,000-a-month losses until the end of
September.
The balance of the losses will be underwritten by the London Docklands
Development Corporation, the City of London, some riverside London boroughs,
and leading Docklands companies.
