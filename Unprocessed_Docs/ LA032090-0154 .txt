French actress Capucine, who played the slinky seductress in the first "Pink Panther" movie, jumped to her death from her eighth-floor apartment, police reported today. 
The 57-year-old actress, who starred in movies with such Hollywood stars as John Wayne, Stewart Granger and Peter Sellers, took her life Saturday, police said. 
Swiss media said friends who knew her since she moved to Lausanne on Lake Geneva 28 years ago reported that she had lately been ill and depressed. 
Born in Toulon, France, as Germaine Lefebvre, Capucine first studied painting and then became a model. She won Hollywood fame in films of the late 1960s. 
Beautiful, tall and dark-haired, Capucine was the slinky femme fatale in the first of the "Pink Panther" comedy films with Sellers playing the loony French police inspector. 
She chose the stage name Capucine from the French for an exotic ornamental South American flower with large petals that are typically orange.
