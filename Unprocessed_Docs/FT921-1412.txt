The group of pro-Labour scientists who wrote to The Times yesterday were
stretching a point. 'Between 1974 and 1979,' they said, 'British scientists
won six Nobel prizes. In 1980-85 the number dropped to four, and for 1986-91
there was just one British laureate.'
About the long-term trend, they may well be right, but there is a time lag
in these matters and it is surely pushing it a bit to claim the number of
prizes between 1974-79 as a triumph for the Labour government of that
period.
Most Nobel prizes are based on research done five to 20 years previously,
though the interval between a discovery and its recognition by the Nobel
committee varies enormously.
Cesar Milstein of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge
discovered monoclonal antibodies - a key development in molecular biology -
in 1976 and won a Nobel Prize in 1984, which was fast by Nobel standards.
On the other hand, Peyton Rous discovered in 1911 that viruses can cause
cancer. He won the prize in 1966. Perhaps the scientists who did their best
work in the Thatcher period will get their reward by the millennium.
