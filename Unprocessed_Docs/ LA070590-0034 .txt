As a counselor for recovering addicts I must say that the government's treatment of Washington Mayor Marion Barry was very sleazy. Worse, it was immoral. 
Here we have the mayor stating on FBI tape that he has been clean for a while. The quote is "I've been so goddamn good . . . I've even surprised myself . . . no women and none of that kind of (cocaine) stuff." Yet, what do our police servants do? They entice Barry to fall off the wagon. They actually bring him cocaine, drug paraphernalia, and a friend to talk him into using it. 
Recidivism is very common among users trying to quit. Yet to have our very own government officials take advantage of that fact, just so that they can score a few political points and thereby quiet a critic of the Bush Administration is very shameful. 
Further though, is the greater irony that while Barry's fall from grace was being orchestrated, the same FBI and Bush Administration were not taking any meaningful action on the reports that officers and friends in the U.S. attorney general's office were also doing cocaine.
