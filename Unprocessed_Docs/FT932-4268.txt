GOVERNMENT plans to privatise most of the ship inspection work carried out
by the Department of Transport were criticised yesterday by marine insurers.
Mr Roger Nixon, chairman of the Lloyds' Underwriters Association'sjoint hull
committee, gave evidence to the Donaldson inquiry into last January's Braer
oil-spill off the Shetland Islands.
He warned that contracting-out ship safety checks would weaken Britain's
ability to carry out its international obligations.
The hearingwas told that ship safety checks might be carried out in future
by private ship classification societies, whose standards have been
continually criticised during the hearing.
Mr Nixon said every society needed 'its policemen'.
Mr Nixon revealed that London underwriters are in dispute over the
sea-worthiness of oil tankers which Salvage Association surveys had found to
be sub-standard after being passed safe to sail by five reputable societies.
Mr Nixon told Lord Donaldson, who is chairing the hearing, that he had
photographic evidence of one tanker inspected in Hong Kong which
demonstrated that the crew had covered up rust holes 'with painted canvas'.
The hearing continues.
