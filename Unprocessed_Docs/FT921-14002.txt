NEW ZEALAND appears poised to increase its profitable live sheep trade with
Saudi Arabia following successful talks on health regulations with the Saudi
government. New Zealand has emerged as the main exporter of live sheep to
Saudi Arabia since exports from Australia began to decline in 1989 following
Saudi complaints about the health of some animals.
Mr John Falloon, the New Zealand agriculture minister, said the talks had
been complex and difficult, but had resulted in an understanding that would
allow the trade to continue.
New Zealand sent 1.6m live sheep to Saudi Arabia last year, including
500,000 intended for the Haj religious festival. Exports are likely to
increase this year in the absence of competition from Australia.
The trade has been an important success story for New Zealand farmers at a
time when many have suffered financial hardship as a result of falling wool
prices, mostly caused by over-production in Australia.
Live sheep have also helped to offset falling Middle East demand for exports
of New Zealand sheep carcasses, which fell to 43,000 tonnes in 1990-91,
compared with 150,000 tonnes in 1986-87. However, the live sheep trade
remains prone to interruption because of Saudi sensitivity to real or
perceived health problems, in spite of strenuous New Zealand efforts to
guarantee the condition of the animals.
The trade is directly controlled by the New Zealand government, which sends
two veterinarians with each shipment, and allows only one shipload to be on
the water at any time.
New Zealand sheep sold into the trade also tend to be young animals, which
are better able to cope with the stress of the journey than the older
wethers (castrated males) usually shipped to the Middle East from Australia.
Officials say this is because of the structure of the New Zealand sheep
industry, which is more geared to lamb production than the
fine-wool-oriented Australian industry.
Mr Falloon said relations with Australia's primary industries ministry
remained good, in spite of the effective transfer of the Saudi trade from
Australia to New Zealand.
Officials in Canberra said Australia expected exports to Saudi Arabia to
recommence following talks now taking place, but there is little hope of an
early resumption.
'We have endeavoured to use all reasonable channels to negotiate with the
Saudis, and we have found that extremely difficult. We go through stages
where there are glimmers of hope, and stages where there is not. Right now
the talks are still going on, but we are not optimistic,' said an official.
The live sheep trade was worth about ADollars 200m in export revenue to
Australia at its peak in 1988, of which about half was accounted for by
exports to Saudi Arabia. Problems began in 1989, when shipments were
rejected after the Saudis claimed some sheep were infected with the deadly
disease blue tongue or brucellosis, which causes abortions.
Australian officials claimed blue tongue did not exist in Australia in its
clinical form (although the virus which causes it has been detected in some
flocks), and pointed out that all the sheep alleged to be suffering from
brucellosis were males.
However, Saudi complaints continued, mostly in relation to less serious
diseases such as pink eye, a form of conjunctivitis, and scabby mouth, a
viral disease which in some circumstances can be contracted by humans.
Officials say Australia is keen to reach an accommodation with Saudi Arabia,
but has so far been unable to agree on a health regime that is acceptable to
both sides.
Live sheep sales to other Middle East countries have not been affected by
the dispute with the Saudis, and Australia remains a major exporter to
Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. --------------------------------------------------------------------    AUSTRALIAN LIVE SHEEP EXPORTS (MILLIONS, 1988 - 1991 AVERAGE) --------------------------------------------------------------------                    Saudi Arabia      Other Middle East    Total
