Safety Robert Blackmon returned two interceptions for touchdowns and set up another with a third interception Saturday as Baylor routed Texas, 50-7, for its first victory at Austin since 1951. 
The 50 points were the most scored by Baylor against Texas in a series that started in 1901, and the victory margin was the greatest for Baylor in 79 games against Texas. 
The victory was quite a turnaround for Baylor, which lost, 6-3, to Rice last Saturday. 
Blackmon reached below his knees to intercept Texas quarterback Peter Gardere's pass, which was tipped by Texas receiver Tony Jones, and ran 20 yards for a touchdown with 9:36 left in the first quarter. 
Blackmon out-jumped Jones for reserve quarterback Donovan Forbes' pass and ran 35 yards with the interception for his second touchdown with 11:42 remaining in the half. 
Blackmon's third interception, off Gardere, and his 26-yard return set up a two-yard touchdown by Anthony Ray to give Baylor a 43-0 lead late in the third quarter. 
Baylor, ranked No. 11 nationally in defense, finished its season with a 5-6 record, 4-4 in the Southwest Conference. Texas is 5-5 and 4-3. 
The loss by Texas clinched the SWC football championship for Arkansas, which defeated Texas A&M, 23-22, Friday. 
Texas had eight turnovers and never started a possession beyond its 25 until Baylor lost a fumble fumble at its 2. Texas then scored on Adrian Walker's 1-yard dive to avoid its first shutout since 1980.
