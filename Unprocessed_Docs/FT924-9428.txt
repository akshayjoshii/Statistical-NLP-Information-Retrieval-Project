Sir, Regarding 'Men's club still proves elusive' (November 2), how would you
feel if you were selected the most qualified out of 250 job applicants?
Pretty good, what? Then you were told that you didn't stand a chance to be
invited to an interview. How do you feel now? - in fighting spirit, I hope.
And when you finally have the recruitment consultant pinned to the wall and
he confesses that it's because you are the wrong shape, what's your next
move?
His excuse? 'My client, the managing director, prefers to discuss business
in the john rather than in the board-room.'
Well, that managing director deserves all he gets in there, don't you think?
