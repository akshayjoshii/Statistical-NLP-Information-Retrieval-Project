Helmut Kohl of Germany receives a bunch of flowers in the German parliament
yesterday after he was re-elected chancellor with one vote to spare in a
ballot in the lower house. The presentation was made by fellow member of
parliament Brigitte Baumeister. Watching is the foreign minister, Klaus
Kinkel. Mr Kohl's razor-thin majority is not unprecedented in postwar German
politics. In 1949 the Christian Democrat father figure Konrad Adenauer won
what was then the minimum 202 votes needed to become Bonn's first
chancellor. In 1969, Willy Brandt was only two votes over the minimum and
seven years later Helmut Schmidt cleared the hurdle with only one vote to
spare.
