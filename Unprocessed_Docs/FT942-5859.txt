Alpha Airports Group has formed a joint venture with Connat Flight Services,
Australia's largest independent flight caterer, through the acquisition of
49 per cent of the company for some ADollars 7.5m (Pounds 3.7m).
Connat serves Quantas and Ansett, Australia's two international airlines. In
1992-93 it made Pounds 1.3m pre-tax.
The remaining 51 per cent of the company will continue to be held by the
founders.
