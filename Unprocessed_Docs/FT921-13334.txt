ARTHUR TAYLOR Colliery, a R480m (Dollars 172.7m) joint venture between
subsidiaries of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI) and Total, was
yesterday opened at Witbank, about 130km east of Johannesburg.
The mine represents a significant further investment in the country by the
French Total oil group, already the fourth largest foreign investor in the
country with an annual turnover of about R3bn. Total's stake was wholly
funded by its local coal subsidiary, Tesa, while JCI is involved through
wholly-owned subsidiary Tavistock Collieries.
Although there is an embargo preventing France from buying South African
coal, the opening was attended by representatives of Electricite de France
(EDF), the French electricity utility, Atic, the state coal importer, and
Lafarge, the cement producer. They indicated privately they would lobby the
French government to lift the embargo.
The open-cast mine will produce 2.4m saleable tonnes of export coal at full
capacity. It will be exported through the Richards Bay export terminal on
the east coast.
