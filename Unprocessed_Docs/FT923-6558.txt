Malaysian sea-rescue teams were still searching last night for those missing
after a cruise liner with more than 500 passengers and crew aboard sank in
the Malacca Strait, about 15 miles off Malaysia, writes Kieran Cooke in
Kuala Lumpur.
The Bermuda-registered Royal Pacific was in collision with a Taiwanese
fishing vessel early yesterday. Survivors said it sank in minutes. Malaysian
authorities said most of those on the ship had been rescued but two were
dead and several other passengers missing. Most of those aboard were
believed to be Singaporeans.
