SOLICITORS acting for a smoker with a rare circulatory disorder who is suing
Gallaher, the US-owned cigarette manufacturer, said yesterday his case might
provide the first test of the duty of care that tobacco companies owe to
smokers.
Mr Cormac Fitzpatrick, of Belfast solicitors Vincent P. Fitzpatrick, said he
was confident that it could be proved his client's disease was attributable
to smoking.
Mr John Dean, 37, of Ballywalter, Co Down, suffers from Beurger's disease,
which causes constriction of the arteries and in its most severe form can
lead to gangrene and loss of limbs. The disease is incurable but can be
controlled. Although the condition has not advanced to the serious stage in
Mr Dean's case, he claims that he has been unable to work for seven years
and that his family life has been adversely affected.
Mr Fitzpatrick said the uniqueness of his case lay in the fact that
Beurger's disease is thought to be caused directly by smoking. With other
smoking-related diseases such as heart disease and lung cancer it is hard to
prove nothing else could have caused the disease.
Mr Fitzpatrick said Mr Dean had a strong case because he had only ever
smoked one brand of cigarette, Benson & Hedges, made by Gallaher.
Gallaher said it could not comment on the case but would be defending it
vigorously.
