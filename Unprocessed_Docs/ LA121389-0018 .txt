The Chinese press lashed out at the choice of the Dalai Lama for the Nobel Peace Prize, charging that the choice was politically motivated and instigated by "some Western countries" to pressure China. The exiled spiritual leader of Tibet's Buddhists accepted the award in Norway two days ago. The Dalai Lama fled the Himalayan country in 1959 after an abortive uprising put down by Chinese troops. The Chinese government portrays him as a separatist who incites anti-Chinese sentiment in Tibet.
