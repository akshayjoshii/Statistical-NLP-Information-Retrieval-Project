The German parliament has approved the Transrapid magnetic levitation train
between Berlin and Hamburg after a long dispute which threatened to scupper
the project. With a maximum speed of 450kph (280mph), the Transrapid will
race between the two city centres, providing an alternative to air travel,
according to Thyssen Industrie, the company which has developed the system.
The federal government will spend around DM5.6bn (Pounds 2.3bn) to build the
track cities and a private consortium will operate the service. Total costs
are expected to reach DM10bn and the service is expected to open by 2005.
