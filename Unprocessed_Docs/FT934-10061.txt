TAIWAN plans reforms of its economic policy towards China that will
accelerate Taiwanese investment there and let Taipei play an active role in
promoting it, Chiang Pin-kung, economics minister said, Reuter reports from
Taipei.
The Taiwanese government's system of screening investment in China would be
revised to remove restrictions in many industries, newspapers quoted Chiang
as saying over the weekend.
The government would also change its current policy of 'not encouraging'
Taiwanese investment in China to one of 'actively guiding' it in directions
beneficial to Taiwan, he said.
