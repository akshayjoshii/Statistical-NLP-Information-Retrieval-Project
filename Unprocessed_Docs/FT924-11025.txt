MR Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, is to visit Argentina early
next year, his Argentine counterpart Mr Guido di Tella said yesterday,
writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
Mr Di Tella said no date had been agreed for the visit but he expected it
would take place in January.
Preparations for a visit to Britain by President Carlos Menem and bilateral
issues - notably the Falkland islands - are likely to head the two
ministers' agenda.
However, British officials fear a visit by Mr Menem would add to Prime
Minister John Major's political headaches. The government could face
criticism from within Conservative ranks if it was seen to be making
concessions over the Falklands.
