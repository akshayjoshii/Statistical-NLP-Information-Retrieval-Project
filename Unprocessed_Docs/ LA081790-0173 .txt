BellSouth Corp. is going ahead with plans to develop an advanced cellular telephone network in New Zealand, believed to be the first such system in the Southern Hemisphere. 
The Atlanta-based telecommunications company announced today it is proceeding with the project following approval from the New Zealand Commerce Commission. 
BellSouth spokeswoman Carlton Hill said the company plans to spend $100 million over 10 years to develop the network and will begin offering cellular phone service to New Zealanders in 1992.
