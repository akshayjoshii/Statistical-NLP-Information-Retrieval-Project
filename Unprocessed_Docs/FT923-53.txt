NEW YORK orange juice futures plunged again yesterday on prospects of a big
Florida orange crop. Private estimates have ranged from 155m to 175m boxes.
But some analysts believe the US Department of Agriculture figure, to be
released on October 8, could be as high as 200m. In late trading the
November contract was down 3.8 cents at 104.8 cents a lb.
