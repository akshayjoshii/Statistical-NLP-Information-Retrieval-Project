Armed Jewish settlers and Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 18 Palestinians
in Hebron, the town in the Israel occupied West Bank which has been a flash
point of Arab -Israeli violence. Palestinian witnesses said trouble began
after Jewish settlers tried to enter a mosque and beat women praying. The
Israeli army barred from the area international observers sent to the town
after the February mosque massacre of 30.
