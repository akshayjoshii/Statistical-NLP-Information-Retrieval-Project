THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has
launched a campaign to reduce huge differences in export credit insurance
premiums charged by its members, which distort free competition in sales
from the industrialised to the developing world. OECD headquarters in Paris
has invited trade officials from its 24 member countries to meet next autumn
to share information on 'six or seven' Third World countries, to which the
costs of export credit insurance vary widely between different OECD
exporters.
Meetings to exchange information on commercials risks in other Third World
markets are expected to follow.
Officials are unwilling to give precise examples of which countries charge
too little or too much.
However, a recent OECD study shows that premiums on export credit insurance
to one African country vary between OECD members from a minimum of 6 per
cent to a maximum of 26 per cent of contract value.
'It is complete chaos. There are very large differences which are
commercially inexplicable,' said an official.
If the meetings are successful, OECD officials believe export credit
insurance premiums within the industrialised bloc should converge over the
next few years.
Patchy information on Third World market risks accounts for most of the
differences, said an OECD expert.
The study shows no evidence of attempts by the governments of exporting
countries to subsidise overseas sales by encouraging providers of export
credit guarantees - often state-owned  - to charge unrealistically low
premiums.
However, the move is consistent with a separate OECD campaign which is aimed
at preventing governments from mixing aid funds with commercial credits, so
as to win export markets.
