Fourteen sailors suffered smoke inhalation when a Navy helicopter carrier caught fire in Long Beach Naval Station, but there was no serious damage to the ship. 
The Peleliu, an amphibious assault ship used as a helicopter carrier, caught fire on Friday night, Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser said. 
The fire apparently broke out in the circuit breaker room, where a cable from shore powers the ship while in port. The cause of the fire was not known, but an investigation was under way. 
Damage was minimal and the 14 sailors who suffered smoke inhalation were treated and returned to duty Saturday morning, Chesser said. 
The fire was put out by 10:30 p.m., less then twenty minutes after it was discovered, and repairs to the ship will be made by the crew. 
The Peleliu had recently returned from sea operations, but Chesser did not know the nature of the assignment. The ship normally has a crew of 900.
