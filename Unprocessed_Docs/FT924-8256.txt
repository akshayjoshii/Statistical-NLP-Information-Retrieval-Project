MR BOB Prowse has been appointed chief executive of Bank of New Zealand to
succeed Mr Lindsay Pyne, who resigned on Tuesday, following National
Australia Bank's declaration that its offer for BNZ was unconditional.
Mr Prowse, who was previously chief general manager investments, headed the
NAB team responsible for winning BNZ for NZDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 789m).
He also led NAB's purchase of Yorkshire Bank and played an important role in
the acquisitions of Clydesdale Bank, National Irish Bank and Northern Bank.
NAB also announced that the three directors of Fay, Richwhite, the New
Zealand merchant bank, Sir Michael Fay, Mr Geoff Ricketts and Mr Robin
Congreve have resigned. They are replaced by NAB representatives Mr Bill
Irvine, Mr David Macfarlane, and Mr Don Argus. Mr Tom Tennent, long-serving
BNZ deputy chief executive, has joined the board, as has Mr Bob Stannard,
previously chairman of NAB's New Zealand unit.
