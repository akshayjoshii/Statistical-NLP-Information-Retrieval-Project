WHILE American car makers rail against Japan's Dollars 31bn (Pounds 17.1bn)
automotive trade surplus with the US, the Big Three themselves, General
Motors, Ford and Chrysler, now account for nearly a sixth of all the
Japanese-derived cars sold in the US.
Japanese makers led by Honda, Toyota and Nissan boosted their direct share
of US new car sales to 30.2 per cent in 1991 from 27.8 per cent a year
earlier. But Japanese producers' overall share of the US new car market is
significantly higher, thanks to the efforts of the US car makers.
GM, Ford and Chrysler all sell under their own badges Japanese cars - both
direct imports from Japan and cars assembled by Japanese plants in the US,
the so-called transplants - despite their increasing opposition to the level
of Japanese car sales in the US.
The Big Three's sales of Japanese-derived cars in the US totalled 473,068
last year and accounted for 16 per cent of all Japanese-related car sales in
America. Including both the Japanese makers' own car sales and
Japanese-derived cars sold by GM, Ford and Chrysler, the Japanese auto
makers captured a record 36 per cent of the US new car market last year,
against 33.5 per cent in 1990. The US car makers' marketing efforts for the
Japanese producers include:
General Motors has established a special franchise, called Geo, as part of
its Chevrolet division, for the sale of a range of Japanese-derived
products. Geo car sales totalled 265,992 last year. The Geo Prizm (a
re-badged Toyota Corolla) is produced in the US by NUMMI, the Toyota/GM
joint venture; the Geo Metro (a re-badged Suzuki Swift) by CAMI, the
Suzuki/GM joint venture in Canada (it is also imported from Japan). The
Isuzu Impulse coupe is imported from Japan and sold as the Geo Storm.
Chrysler sells several Mitsubishi Motors models under its Dodge, Plymouth
and Eagle badges. Sales last year totalled 130,781. Models such as the Dodge
Stealth (a re-badged Mitsubishi 3000 GT) are imported from Japan, while
others like the Plymouth Laser/Eagle Talon coupe (the Mitsubishi Eclipse)
are built in the US at Mitsubishi Motors' plant in Bloomington-Normal,
Illinois, a wholly-owned Mitsubishi plant (previously a joint venture with
Chrysler).
Ford sells the Ford Probe, a version of the Mazda MX-6 coupe, produced by
Mazda at its Flat Rock, Michigan, plant. Ford Probe sales totalled 76,295 in
the US last year.
Mr Richard Recchia, executive vice-president of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of
America, says the US auto companies are backing legislation that would
further restrict Japanese vehicle sales in the US, while they 'not only
enjoy the benefit of selling imported vehicles, but receive vehicles from
the so-called transplant Japanese manufacturing operations. 'This has all
the earmarks of the pot calling the kettle black.' The US car makers 'view
an imported car or truck as bad, unless it's a 'captive import' sold by one
of the Big Three. Then it's good.'
MR Lee Iacocca, Chrysler chairman and leader of the US auto industry's
campaign to cut Japan's trade surplus, ignores the Big Three's own sales of
Japanese cars in his attacks on Japan. Japan has the US auto industry
'targeted and they're not about to take us out of their gunsights,' he said
on his return this month from Tokyo. 'We ship them food and chemicals and
raw materials, just like a colony. And they ship us value-added cars and
machine tools and electronics, just like a mother-country.'
While GM is being forced to cut its domestic operations drastically, the
Japanese presence in North America is still expanding. After the wave of
investment in the 1980s by Japanese vehicle makers in assembly plants in
North America (eight in the US and three in Canada), Japanese producers
accounted for 24.9 per cent of total US car output last year, increasing
their share from 21.7 per cent in 1990.
Car output by the Japanese transplants in the US (including NUMMI) increased
by 1.1 per cent to 1.33m, despite the recession in US new car sales, and in
contrast to the 11.7 per cent drop in overall US car output to 5.36m.
Japanese car production capacity in the US is being further expanded with
Toyota spending Dollars 800m to almost double its Georgetown, Kentucky,
plant to 420,000 cars a year by the end of 1993 (220,000 at present), and
Nissan spending Dollars 490m virtually to double its car and light truck
capacity at its Smyrna, Tennessee, plant to 440,000 units a year by
mid-1992. The transplants' total car and light truck production capacity in
North America is planned to reach 2.7m vehicles a year by 1993/94 following
a Dollars 7.5bn investment.
Mr Bob McCurry, executive vice-president of Toyota Motor Sales USA, says
that, with the build-up of their assembly plants in North America, Japanese
car makers have achieved 'one of the largest and quickest industrial
transfers' in modern times. ----------------------------------------------------------------------             US AUTO INDUSTRY JANUARY-DECEMBER 1991 ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Volume     Volume     Share (%)     Share (%)                          (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Dec 91    Jan-Dec 90 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
