City lawmakers in the Chinese capital have called for jails to be built to house prostitutes and urged severe punishment, including the death sentence, for anyone who induces or coerces women into prostitution, the official New China News Agency said Friday. 
The municipal government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its first anti-prostitution statutes, the agency said. 
China has national laws against prostitution, but penalties are generally light. According to a 1986 law, women caught selling sexual favors are detained for less than 15 days or, in more serious cases, sent to labor reform camps.
