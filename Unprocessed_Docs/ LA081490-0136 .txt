Four residents who participated in the Gay Games in Canada last week have returned home with 11 medals, according to one of the winners. 
Richard Ammon, a clinical psychologist who competed for the second time in the international amateur athletic contest, said members of Team Laguna won medals for swimming and tennis in competitions divided by age categories. 
More than 7,500 athletes from at least a dozen nations took part in the Gay Games III and Cultural Festival, which were observed by thousands of spectators, he said. Ammon, who won two silver and two bronze medals in the age 45 to 49 category, said he was nervous and excited during the competition, but the overall environment was supportive. 
"It's not killer competition," he said. "It's genuinely friendly." 
Another Team Laguna member, Robert Mastroberti, won a bronze medal for swimming in the 25 to 29 age category. Two other Laguna residents won a total of six medals in swimming and tennis competitions.
