SUPPORTERS of controversial efforts to patent human genes won a victory at
the weekend with the resignation of Mr James Watson as head of the US
government's human gene research project.
Mr Watson, a Nobel prize winner for his part in discovering the DNA double
helix, is an outspoken opponent of recent attempts to patent pieces of human
genes.
The issue has divided scientific communities in the US, Japan and Europe
which are mapping all 100,000 genes in the human body. At stake is the
potential for billions of dollars of revenue from buyers of genetic
information, such as drug companies
Mr Watson was director of the Human Genome Project, the Washington-based
federal research organisation. The project is part of the National Institute
of Health (NIH), the US federal agency which is spending more than Dollars
150m (Pounds 87.2m) a year on the 20-year programme. The EC and Japan are
each putting in about one fifth as much again into the same project at local
research establishments.
Mr Watson's resignation comes at the same time as an inquiry by the NIH
ethics officer into a potential conflict of interest because of his
shareholdings in biotechnology companies. However, many believe he left
because of policy differences with Ms Bernadine Healy, who became director
of the NIH last year.
Mr Watson handed in his resignation on Friday saying it would allow Ms Healy
'to appoint her own director' of the Genome project.
Debate over the patenting of human genes reached a head last summer after a
US laboratory filed, under the auspices of the NIH, 347 patents for pieces
of human DNA.
'Virtually all scientists have opposed this,' said Sir Walter Bodmer,
president of the Human Genome Organisation, which co-ordinates human genome
research globally.
