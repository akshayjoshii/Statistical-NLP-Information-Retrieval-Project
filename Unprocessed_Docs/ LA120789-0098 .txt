The Los Angeles City Council has urged the Port of Los Angeles to find a berth for the merchant ship Lane Victory, but it stopped short of recommending that the ship be placed at Berth 87 in San Pedro, near the Los Angeles Maritime Museum. 
The 11-0 vote represented a partial victory for the Long Beach-based U.S. Merchant Marine Veterans World War II, which has been trying to renovate the ship into a floating museum and is pressing the Harbor Department to give up Berth 87. 
The Harbor Department has repeatedly refused the group's requests, saying it needs Berth 87 for use as a container terminal. However, spokeswoman Julia Nagano said, "We are working with them to find a permanent home and we are very supportive of their venture." 
The council's resolution, introduced by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, asks the Harbor Department to find a home for the ship "in a locale with easy public access and adequate parking accommodations, where it will serve as a memorial museum and benefit the residents of Los Angeles and all of Southern California."
