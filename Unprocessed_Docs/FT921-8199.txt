CHINA will need foreign capital and manufacturing expertise to go ahead with
the Three Gorges project to control flooding in the middle reaches of the
Yangtze River through construction of a huge dam, Simon Holberton reports
from Hong Kong.
Zhao Chuanshao, a ministry of water resources official, said China was
'interested in securing foreign loans' to finance the multi-million-dollar
project and leading foreign manufacturers to help make parts for the
project, the English-language China Daily reported yesterday.
China would be willing to import technologies and materials to build the
680,000KW turbo-generators and the 500,000-volt transmission lines to carry
electricity generated.
The dam would dwarf any in the US and exceed the capacity of Brazil's dam at
Itaipu, the world's biggest.
A water level of 150 metres would produce a reservoir stretching 250 miles.
