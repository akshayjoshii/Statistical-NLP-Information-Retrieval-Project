Men lose roughly 2% of their existing bone mass per year in the same type of loss that can severely affect women after menopause, a three-year study indicates. 
"There is a problem with osteoporosis in men that hasn't been appreciated," said Dr. Eric Orwoll, who led the study by the Oregon Health Sciences University at Portland. Men apparently suffer gradual bone loss throughout their lives, while women often suffer a marked increase in bone loss after they reach menopause, Orwoll said. Researchers believe bone loss in women is related to the decrease in estrogen levels associated with menopause.
