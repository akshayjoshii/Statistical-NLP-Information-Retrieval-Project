The Bundesbank cannot simply ignore recent explosive growth in its M3 money
supply measure, nor can it count on continuing falls in import prices to
reduce inflation, Mr Hans Tietemeyer, Bundesbank president, said yesterday,
writes Christopher Parkes. Ruling out 'hasty' reductions in interest rates,
he told a meeting in Frankfurt the central bank had to keep a close watch on
price developments. Basic trends suggested further easing in price pressure
in the coming months, and February's M3 data, released earlier this week,
showed a slight slowing in monetary growth compared with January. But growth
at an annual rate of 17.6 per cent, compared with the bank's 4-6 per cent
target range, could signal inflation, Mr Tietmeyer said. A February
inflation rate of 3.4 per cent, which he compared with France's 1.8 per
cent, was still clearly too high.
