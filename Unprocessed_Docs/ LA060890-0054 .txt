The "ghoulish remains of Boris," a hurricane about 500 miles off the coast of San Diego, will smother San Diego with warm, muggy weather and clouds much of the weekend, according to the National Weather Service. 
Boris has been downgraded from a hurricane, packing 100 m.p.h. winds, to a tropical depression, said forecaster Wilbur Shigehara. The disturbance is rapidly breaking up but will cast a pall today and Saturday, bringing a possible thunderstorm to the mountains and deserts and warm, muggy weather to other areas. 
"If we can live through Saturday, a cooling trend on Sunday will take all the muggies away," Shigehara said. 
The humidity will range from 45% to 60% inland and 60% to 75% along the coast. Normally, the humidity for this time of year is 65% coupled with cool temperatures, he said. But 65% humidity together with warmer than normal temperatures feels a lot more humid. 
Sunday will be cooler and sunny because of low pressure coming in from the Gulf of Alaska, Shigehara said. 
Temperatures at the beaches will range from 67 to 73 today and Saturday, cooling about three degrees on Sunday, Shigehara said. The surf is up, rolling in at 3 to 5 feet and the ocean is 66 degrees. 
In the coastal areas, temperatures today and Saturday will be 72 to 84, dropping as much as seven degrees on Sunday. Nights will be 60 to 67 degrees. 
Inland areas will be 85 to 95 today and Saturday. On Sunday, the mercury could fall as much as 10 degrees as the low-pressure front comes in, Shigehara said. Nighttime temperatures will be 56 to 64 tonight and Saturday. 
Temperatures in mountain areas will be 76 to 82 today, and 72 to 78 Saturday and Sunday. Nighttime lows will be 45 to 55. 
Desert temperatures will be 98 to 106 today and Saturday, dropping to 95 to 100 Sunday. Nighttime temperatures will be 72 to 77 tonight, 65 to 77 Saturday, and drop a few more degrees Sunday.
