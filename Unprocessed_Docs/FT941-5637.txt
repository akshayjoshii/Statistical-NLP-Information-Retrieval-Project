The first enterprise zone trust for industrial property development is
expected to bring enhanced financial benefits to the Scottish economy,
according to Scottish Enterprise, the economic development body.
It calls the scheme - in the Lanarkshire enterprise zone - unique in the UK.
Akeler Developments of Leeds, which is to raise Pounds 20m from private
investors through an enterprise zone trust, will pass most of the financial
surplus it makes on a 250,000 sq ft industrial development at Blantyre in
Lanarkshire to Scottish Enterprise. That will be used on economic
regeneration projects in Lanarkshire and elsewhere.
In return Scottish Enterprise and Akeler will form a partnership which could
lead to Akeler's involvement in other industrial developments, and Scottish
Enterprise will guarantee investors the rental income on the factories for
up to 10 years.
Scottish Enterprise says it was able to secure this deal because of strong
interest in the Lanarkshire zone among enterprise development specialists.
The enterprise zone trust is marketed by Capital Ventures of Cheltenham,
Gloucestershire, an enterprise zone trust sponsor.
