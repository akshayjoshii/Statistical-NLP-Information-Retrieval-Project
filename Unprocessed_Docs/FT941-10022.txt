Pregnant women in Europe and East Asia could be offered a blood test as
early as this autumn to determine definitively whether the child has genetic
abnormalities. The new probes, developed by Aprogenex, of Houston, work on a
simple blood sample removed from the mother's arm.
One probe identifies the foetal cells by their RNA, a unique marker showing
which genes are active in the cell. RNA can be used to differentiate between
two cells in the same person, where the DNA is identical - an eye cell and a
hair cell, for example.
Further probes then check the chromosomes on the foetal cells for
abnormalities. Aprogenex: US, 713 748 5114.
