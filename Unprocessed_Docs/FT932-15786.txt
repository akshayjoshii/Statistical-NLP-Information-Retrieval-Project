TRANSPORT spending will jump by 10 per cent next year if Mr Federico Pena,
transportation secretary, wins Congress's support for his Dollars 40.2bn
(Pounds 26.6bn) budget request, writes George Graham.
Although more than half the transport budget will still go to roads and
bridges, the administration's budget provides Dollars 4.6bn next year for
mass transit - 50 per cent more than the Bush administration requested last
year and 21 per cent higher than the even more generous allocation provided
by Congress. Much of the money will go towards new metro trains and safer,
cleaner buses.
'The past administration had an anti-transit bias. Our administration has a
pro-transit bias,' Mr Pena said.
High-speed rail technology and tracks, including development of a prototype
magnetic levitation train, are to get Dollars 1.3bn over five years,
starting with Dollars 140m in 1994.
The administration proposes to extend a 2.5 cents per gallon supplemental
petrol tax, currently earmarked for deficit reduction, until 1999 and shift
2 cents of it back to highway construction and 1/2 cent to transit.
