The five presidents of Central America apparently have agreed to hold a long-delayed regional peace summit Feb. 8-9 in El Salvador, Nicaraguan officials said. A senior Foreign Ministry official said the summit, postponed four times since last August, "is almost a sure thing". A government statement said Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega telephoned the leaders of Guatemala and Costa Rica to confirm the dates. President Oscar Arnulfo Arias of Costa Rica, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his regional peace plan, had asked that a meeting scheduled for Jan. 15 be postponed until President-elect Bush takes office today.
