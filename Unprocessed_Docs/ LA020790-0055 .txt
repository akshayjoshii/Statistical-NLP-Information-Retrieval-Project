Radicals campaigning for Maori rights heckled Queen Elizabeth II in New Zealand during celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of a treaty between Maori chiefs and British colonial authorities. 
One young woman was arrested for throwing a T-shirt at the British monarch. The queen, accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, appeared shaken by the incident in Waitangi. Maoris are descendants of Polynesians who arrived in what is now New Zealand more than 1,000 years ago. Radicals say New Zealand governments have not honored the treaty, which guaranteed them possession of their lands.
