George Caswell, who was city administrator in the 1960s, has returned to the city as interim city administrator. 
The City Council on Monday appointed Caswell and instructed city staff members to begin recruiting a permanent city administrator. Caswell is expected to be with the city for three or four months. 
Caswell was Azusa's city administrator from 1960 to 1963. He replaces Fred Diaz, who left Oct. 25 to become city manager in Indio.
