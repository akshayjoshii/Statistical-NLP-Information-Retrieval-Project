Two senior members of the Perkins family, mainstays of Sandell Perkins, the
builders merchants which merged with rivals Travis Arnold in 1988, are
stepping down having reached retirement age.
David Perkins, 57, is retiring as managing director of the merged Travis
Perkins group at the end of June. His brother Timothy Perkins, who is 60 in
June, is also retiring as an executive director of the group although he
will remain non-executive chairman. Company policy is that senior executives
should retire between the ages of 57 and 60; between them the two brothers
hold less than 5 per cent of Travis Perkins shares.
David Perkins will be replaced as managing director of the group by Ted
Adams, 53, who will remain managing director of Travis Perkins Trading, the
company's main subsidiary, a position he has held since 1990.
Adams, a chartered accountant, joined timber merchants Sandell, Smythe and
Drayson in 1968. He became finance director of Sandell Perkins four years
later, subsequently becoming managing director and then executive chairman
of Sandell Perkins.
