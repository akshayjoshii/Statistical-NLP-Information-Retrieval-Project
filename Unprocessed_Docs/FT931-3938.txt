LONDON'S state-owned Docklands Light Railway is to pay a private-sector
contractor Pounds 30m over the next three years to manage the expansion of
the railway and make the trains run on time.
Brown & Root, the US engineering contractor, is to manage and co-ordinate
contracts for the introduction of new trains and signalling systems and
oversee the commissioning of an extension of the railway to Beckton in the
Royal Docks.
The deal is unusual in Britain's railway industry as British Rail and London
Underground normally take sole responsibility for the management of railway
projects.
Last year the government transferred ownership of the notoriously unreliable
DLR from London Transport to the London Docklands Development Corporation
and installed a new management team led by Sir Peter Levene, former head of
defence procurement at the Ministry of Defence.
Sir Peter said appointment of an external company was one of the first
decisions taken by the new management team.
Although new to railways, he said, the approach was commonplace in defence
procurement - as, for example, when a company such as British Aerospace is
appointed as prime contractor for a defence project.
Brown & Root, a partner in the consortium running Plymouth's Devonport
dockyard, will be paid in stages according to its success in reaching
specific targets in the railway's development.
Its first task will be to get the Beckton extension into passenger service
by October this year. It then has to introduce a new signalling and control
system to the rest of the railway and make sure the new fleet of trains
being phased in works with the new control system.
