Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary archbishop of El Salvador, applauded the arrest of eight military men in connection with the murder of six priests but decried a "conspiracy of silence" within the military Establishment. 
"It's not enough to punish some," Rosa Chavez said. "It is necessary to completely revise the criteria to define who are really enemies of the people and enemies of the state." President Alfredo Cristiani on Saturday announced the arrest of four officers and four soldiers in the November massacre of six Jesuits and their housekeeper and her daughter.
