A REDUCTION in the number of house repossessions would give a strong
stimulus to house prices, according to an article in the latest Bank of
England quarterly bulletin.
It argues that in the short run house prices respond more rapidly to reduced
repossessions than to interest rate changes.
According to research by the Bank's economics division, a reduction in the
number of house repossessions by 20,000 for one year (there were about
75,000 last year) would increase house prices by about 5 per cent above
rises that would otherwise have occurred.
The increase in prices would in turn reduce the number of house
repossessions by a further 6,000 by increasing the value of housing equity.
A second simulation shows that a reduction in house repossessions of 4,000
would cause house prices to rise by 1.7 per cent in the first year.
'As well as the general cost of initiating a possession, the current scale
of possessions is having a significant effect on house prices,' the article
says.
The authors suggest that that depressing effect explains recent efforts by
lenders to initiate mortgage rescue schemes.
