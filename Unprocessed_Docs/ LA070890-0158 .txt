Anthony A. Tedeschi, a vaudeville and Broadway violinist who last played for the musical "Fiddler on the Roof," has died. He was 88. 
Tedeschi died Wednesday in Los Angeles of undisclosed causes. 
A native of Naples, Italy, Tedeschi immigrated to the United States with his family when he was 4 and began studying violin at age 6. During his long career, he performed with such stars as Fanny Brice, Fred Astaire, the Andrews Sisters, and the Marx Brothers. A personal friend of the Schuberts, he worked many years on Broadway for the Schubert Theatre chain. 
Tedeschi also performed on early television shows including "The Lucky Strike Hour," "The Jackie Gleason Show," and "The Morey Amsterdam Show." 
He is survived by his four sons, Arthur, Robert, Richard, and Meadow, three sisters, and seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
