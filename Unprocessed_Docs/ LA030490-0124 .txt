"Little Dorrit: Nobody's Fault" Showtime, Monday at noon and "Little Dorrit's Story" Showtime, Tuesday at noon. Christine Edzard's two-part, six-hour 1987 film is pure astonishment from start to finish, offering Charles Dickens with sweep and perfection-and a shattering relevancy. 
Amid the cream of British actors are Derek Jacobi in the title role as a businessman returning to London after long years in China and Sarah Pickering as the demure, devoted daughter of an outrageous bankrupt aririocrat, played gloriously by Alec Guinness.

Cinemax, Thursday at 7:30 a.m. This 1987 film is the best kind of surprise-a small, frequently funny, fine-boned film set in the worlds of the theater and the movies that unexpectedly becomes a consummate study of love, alienation and loss. In a blazing comet of a performance, Sally Kirkland plays a one-time Czech movie star in this New York-made film about the irreconcilable pangs of exile directed by Yurek Bogayevicz and written by Polish film maker Agnieszka Holland.
