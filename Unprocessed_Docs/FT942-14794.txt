An Afro-Caribbean careers officer claimed she was ousted from her job in the
race relations unit of the Department of Employment because of her colour.
Miss Wilel McKenzie told an industrial tribunal in Croydon, south London,
that she was excluded from work in the office, and had clients taken away.
She was a higher executive officer and is claiming constructive dismissal
and racial discrimination.
Miss McKenzie's boss denied there had been racial discrimination. The
hearing is expected to end by Friday.
