Mr Gary Davey, deputy managing director of BSkyB, is taking over as chief
executive of Star TV, the Asian satellite venture, 'with immediate effect'.
Mr Davey, who worked for Sky Television since 1983, before its merger with
BSB to form BSkyB, replaces Mr Jim Griffiths, who began running the
five-channel Star in August after Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation took
a majority stake in a Dollars 525m deal.
The previous chief executive of Star, Mr Julian Mounter, decided to resign
soon after Mr Murdoch took control.
Star, which broadcasts by satellite to 38 Asian countries, is now believed
to be available in more than 20m homes.
Last year Mr Murdoch made it clear that he wanted to have specially tailored
services for India and China, because they were such different cultures. A
separate Indonesian service could follow later.
One possibility is a specially dedicated channel for the Indian
sub-continent. At the moment the package distributed everywhere includes BBC
World Service Television, MTV and a Chinese language channel.
The future of the BBC channel on Star was yesterday said to be 'under
discussion'; there is said to be a break point in the contract later this
year. Star has been planning the launch of a pay television film service in
Asia for some time, but no firm launch date has been set and the matter is
said to be under review.
Mr Sam Chisholm, managing director of BSkyB, a consortium in which News Corp
has a 50 per cent stake and Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a
stake, remains in overall charge of both BSkyB and Star.
Pearson's bid for Star failed because the company insisted that Star founder
and Hong Kong billionaire Mr Li Ka-shing remain an investor until after the
return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule.
