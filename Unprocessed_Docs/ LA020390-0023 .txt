A jury of seven women and five men was selected in the trial of Joseph Hazelwood, who was the skipper aboard the Exxon Valdez when it hit a reef and caused the nation's worst oil spill. 
Lawyers settled on the panel of 12 by midday, but questioning continued to seat three alternates in the case. The jury was to be officially impaneled Monday and opening statements will follow. Prosecution and defense lawyers quizzed 52 prospective jurors before settling on the 12 citizens who will spend the next several weeks hearing testimony and considering evidence.
