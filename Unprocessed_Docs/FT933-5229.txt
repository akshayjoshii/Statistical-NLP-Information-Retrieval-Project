Sir, While the Forum of Private Business cannot be faulted on its efforts to
obtain a statutory right to charge interest on overdue debts ('MPs back
right to levy interest on late debts', August 19), I wonder whether its
energy is correctly directed? We already have a right to charge interest on
overdue debts and any experienced credit manager will be able to obtain this
without the need for parliamentary intervention (Interest on Debt Bill).
May I suggest that if the FPB has sums available to pursue this matter, they
be directed towards the training of suitable candidates to become effective
managers of credit.
Credit management is a relatively new profession which has emerged over the
past few years. A good credit manager can make all the difference between
the success or failure of a business. Whether we have a statutory right to
charge interest on the late payment of debts or not, the problem will still
be the collection of this money - all businesses will end up with is a
bigger financial problem unless they have the right people to collect their
debts in the first place.
