So, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown buys his clothes from Marks and
Spencer. We always knew he had much in common with Baroness Thatcher, who in
1986 admitted purchasing M and S underwear.
But does he persuade the store to open its doors early for him to make his
purchases, as happened for health minister Virginia Bottomley, and Norma
Major, the prime minister's wife? Given that the Lib-Dems have complained to
the BBC about the lack of coverage of their Euro-election campaign, what
better way of gaining attention than by asking M and S to open up a little
early so Paddy can buy his suits?
