MERCURY Communications yesterday challenged claims made by British
Telecommunications that it was winning back substantial numbers of business
customers from its main competitor.
Mr Peter Howell-Davies, deputy chief executive of Mercury, said that BT had
won back only about Pounds 6m of business from Mercury, compared with an
increase in Mercury's order book of Pounds 300m in the past financial year.
A comparison of the figures indicated that 'BT's impact has been
negligible,' he said.
Mercury was responding to a claim made by BT at its annual general meeting
on July 30 that it was succeeding in winning back business customers from
Mercury and fending off competition from cable TV companies.
Mercury said it had arrived at the figure of Pounds 6m from its own market
sources. The figure did not mean that BT has won back a number of business
customers altogether but represented just 45 customers at an average of
Pounds 133,000 per customer, Mercury said.
As business customers tended to use BT for local calls and Mercury for
long-distance and international calls, the business that has been won back
by BT could represent a slight shift in balance between the use of the
respective services.
Mercury added that it was continuing to increase its customer base at a rate
of about 19,000 a month. Of these some 12,000 were for its own residential
services and about 7,000 were for services provided in partnership with
cable TV operators.
Mercury provides services in partnership with cable operators in areas
including Birmingham, Portsmouth, Bristol and London. These services provide
users with competitive rates for long-distance, international and local
calls.
