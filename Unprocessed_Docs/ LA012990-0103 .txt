The four London stars of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical "Aspects of Love" will bring the show to Broadway, publicists for the show announced. 
Ann Crumb, Michael Ball, Kevin Colson and Kathleen Rowe McAllen have signed to reprise their London roles when the hit show opens April 8 at the Broadhurst Theater. 
Ball, who is British, and Colson, who is Australian, are being allowed to work on Broadway under an exchange agreement with the actors' union, Actors Equity. Crumb and McAllen are American. 
The situation is in marked contrast to the 1988 Broadway debut of Lloyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera," which was preceded by months of acrimonious negotiation between the composer and the New York branch of Actors Equity over the employment on Broadway of Lloyd Webber's wife, Sarah Brightman. 
Lloyd Webber eventually won, and Brightman opened the show in New York alongside the two other original London stars of "Phantom," Michael Crawford and Steve Barton.
