CHINA has decided to join a global copyright convention as part of its
policy of economic reform, the official New China News Agency said, Reuter
reports from Beijing. Qin Guanlin, representative to Unesco, had officially
notified it of the decision.
US trade negotiators had pressed Beijing to back up promises to protect
patents and copyrights with deeds. China promised last year to join
international copyright organisations.
'The decision was a result of China's policy of deepening reform and opening
to the outside world,' the agency quoted Qin as saying. China would
conscientiously abide by the convention so that copyrights were effectively
protected. China's first copyright law went into effect in June last year.
