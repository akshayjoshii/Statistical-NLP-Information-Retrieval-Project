CHINA yesterday launched a blistering attack against the governor of Hong
Kong, Mr Chris Patten, accusing him of challenging Chinese sovereignty and
of seeking to perpetuate the division of the Chinese people.
An editorial in the communist party newspaper, People's Daily, said Mr
Patten met a senior official of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party, Xu
Shengfa,for a political purpose on November 3. The meeting was held in
Government House where Mr Patten 'openly offered flattery and favours'.
The governor tried to cover this up by claiming the meeting was with members
of a Taiwanese business delegation, the paper said. But on November 9 the
manager of China Travel Service, Mr Li Changyi, disclosed the governor's
guest was a member of the Taiwanese Nationalist Party's central standing
committee.
The People's Daily editorial said: 'Patten's 'break with precedence' is
obviously a challenge to Chinese sovereignty.' Mr Patten wanted to make Hong
Kong an 'independent or semi-independent or self-governing political entity'
to continue British colonial rule.'
