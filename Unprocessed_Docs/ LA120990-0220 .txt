It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas everywhere you go and everywhere you look on television. 
Now through Dec. 25, viewers will be deluged with more than 80 Christmas specials, endless repeats of such holiday films as "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Miracle on 34th Street" and yuletide-themed episodes of TV series. 
Whew! That's enough Christmas cheer to last an entire lifetime. 
NBC has three new holiday movies in the offing: "Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story," featuring John Ritter as the creator of Dorothy, Toto and Co.; "A Mom for Christmas," with Olivia Newton-John as a mannequin who comes to life, and "Guess Who's Coming for Christmas," starring Beau Bridges as a stressed-out alien. 
Dolly Parton is returning to her old Tennessee home for a musical holiday special on ABC and the animated and real New Kids on the Block host a musical yuletide celebration for the network. "All Creatures Great & Small" fans will have something to cheer about: A&E is presenting a two-hour holiday episode Christmas Eve. 
Bravo is airing two versions of the classic ballet "The Nutcracker," and Showtime's daredevil Super Dave will celebrate the holidays in his own unique way. 
Plus a host of Christmas favorites also will be returning: "Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol," "A Charlie Brown Christmas," "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" and "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." 
Below is a guide to select holiday specials that will be airing on the commercial and cable networks, PBS and independent stations. (Some specials may be repeated later in the month.) For airings of holiday movies, please consult TV Times' weekly movie guide.
