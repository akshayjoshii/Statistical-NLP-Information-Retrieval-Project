MR Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, yesterday announced new
measures to improve the testing of blood products in the wake of Germany's
biggest medical scandal.
The new regulations require all blood products, which by law must be tested
against the HIV virus that causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(Aids), to be re-examined before they are put on the market.
The Paul-Erhrlich Institut, which conducts similar procedures for serum and
vaccines, is expected to be given responsibility for the new controls, which
will include detailed lists of all involved in the preparation of these
products.
The regulations include a four to six months quarantine for blood products
as the HIV virus may be present but too young to be detected. They will come
into force on January 1.
Mr Seehofer also announced that the federal state will create a DM20m
(Pounds 8m) fund to compensate AIDS victims who acquire the HIV virus
through a blood transfusion. The German Red Cross said yesterday it would
give an additional DM3m to the national Aids foundation.
The new measures follow allegations last month that UB Plasma, a Koblenz
company, had sold blood products containing the HIV virus. A second company
called Haemoplasma from Lower Saxony is also being investigated for for
allegedly failing to regularly test blood products.
