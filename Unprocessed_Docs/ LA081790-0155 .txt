Amid signs that Donald J. Trump's financial problems are worsening, a report released Thursday shows that the deal maker is in danger of missing a $47-million junk-bond payment due Nov. 15 on the Taj Mahal casino hotel in Atlantic City, N.J. 
The report, released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, is a scathing assessment of the finances of Trump's most costly and lavish investment, the opulent $1-billion gaming palace that opened in April. It also says the Trump Shuttle is dangerously low on cash and the Trump Castle casino hotel, which got an 11th-hour rescue in June, may face a repeat crisis next June. 
Trump, asked at the New Jersey Casino Control Commission hearings about a possible default on the Taj Mahal bond payment, responded with a terse, "No comment."
