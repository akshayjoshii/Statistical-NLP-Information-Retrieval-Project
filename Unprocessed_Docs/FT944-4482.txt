British Gas customers who pre-paid bills to avoid the planned rise in value
added tax will have their money returned in the next few days, the company
said last night.
Eastern Group, the biggest regional power company, also said it would be
making immediate repayments.
British Gas said it did not know how many of its 18m customers had paid in
advance. Eastern Group said yesterday that about 100 of its customers were
affected. 'We know who they are and we are putting a cheque in the post
today,' it said.
East Midlands Electricity and Southern Electric said they would refund
customers who wrote to them.
