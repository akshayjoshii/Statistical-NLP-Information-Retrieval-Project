The six-point cut in the securities repurchase agreement or repo rate to
5.88 per cent last week signalled the Bundesbank's willingness to maintain
its slow relaxation of monetary policy.
This was not enough, however, to temper the market's disappointment over the
reluctance of the central bank to cut either the Lombard or the discount
rate last Thursday.
This week, the prevailing unhappy mood on the bund market is unlikely to be
reversed by preliminary data on inflation for March.
This is likely to be down from a year-on-year rate of 3.4 per cent in
February, showing progress towards the 2 point something the German central
bank is expecting by the end of the year.
But with M3 money supply growth seemingly out of control, the Bundesbank
cannot cut rates generously even if wanted to.
A further reminder of M3 distortions will come this week with the figure for
February. Following a 20 per cent-plus rise for the seasonally adjusted,
annualised January figure, M3 growth in February is likely to be at least 16
per cent.
Even if this can be explained away by special factors, such a figure is
still highly embarrassing in relation to the Bundesbank's M3 target corridor
of 4 to 6 per cent for 1994.
