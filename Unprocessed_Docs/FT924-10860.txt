A LUXURY cross-channel express rail service, offering a three-hour trip from
London to Paris, was unveiled yesterday by the French, Belgian and British
rail boards.
Eurostar will start at the beginning of 1994, soon after the Channel tunnel
opens. It will offer trains between London and Paris and London and
Brussels.
