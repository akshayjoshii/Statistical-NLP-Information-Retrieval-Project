Following the issue of free warrants to existing shareholders, Eurotunnel
has adjusted the number of units for which holders of founder warrants and
1991 warrants are entitled to subscribe.
The holder of one founder warrant can now subscribe for 11.20 units
(previously 10.78) at Pounds 9.72 plus FFr100 (Pounds 11.36). This takes
effect from July 23.
The holder of one 1991 warrant can apply for 1.11 units (formerly 1.07) at
Pounds 1.75 plus FFr17.50.
They are not exercisable at present.
