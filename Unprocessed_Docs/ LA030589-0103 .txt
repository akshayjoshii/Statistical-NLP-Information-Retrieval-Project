Israeli soldiers blocked roads and turned back hundreds of Israeli peace activists hoping to meet and discuss peace with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. But several hundred others sneaked through or were allowed to pass, organizers said. About 1,500 supporters of the Peace Now movement set out from four cities for Arab towns. Troops stopped three groups heading for Ramallah, Nablus and Beit Sahur, a Peace Now spokesman said, but others persuaded soldiers to let them visit two Arab villages near Nablus. Leaders of the Palestinian uprising had called on Arab residents to welcome Peace Now supporters "with open arms."
