STANDARD & Poor's, one of the large Wall Street rating agencies, yesterday
announced that it was reviewing the debt ratings of Allstate Insurance
Company, with a view to possible downgrade, as a result of the insurer's
revised assessment of the losses from Hurricane Andrew earlier this year.
The insurer, one of the largest property-casualty insurers in the US and
part of the Sears, Roebuck financial services and retail group, is currently
projecting a Dollars 2.65bn loss as a result of claims which followed the
hurricane.
The storm system swept through southern Florida and Louisiana in
late-August, causing massive damage and becoming the costliest disaster
which the US insurance industry has ever faced.
S & P suggested yesterday that, if the after-tax charge from the hurricane
was Dollars 1bn at Allstate, and the insurer loses around Dollars 1bn (under
the statutory accounting principles common in the insurance industry, rather
than GAAP), this would raise the operating leverage ratio above three times,
compared with 2.7 times in 1991.
It noted that there was potential to improve the company's capital position,
if and when Sears goes ahead with plans to sell up to 20 per cent of the
equity in Allstate to public investors.
S & P currently has a AA minus claims-paying rating on Allstate Insurance
Company, and its property-casualty subsidiaries.
