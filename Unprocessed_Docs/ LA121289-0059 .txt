Man Charged With Attempted Smuggling: A Las Vegas man was arrested last week at Los Angeles International Airport and charged with attempting to illegally export restricted high-technology materials, federal authorities said. Joseph Nandori, a Hungarian native who authorities said is about 50 years old, was arrested while waiting to board a flight to Budapest. Brooks Ohlson, a special agent with the Commerce Department's Office of Export Enforcement, said Nandori was carrying computer technical manuals, computer software and scientific instruments.
