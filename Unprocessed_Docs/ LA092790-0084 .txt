Malibu's unofficial City Council voted Tuesday to meet twice monthly instead of weekly, beginning in November. 
With the selection of a city attorney, an interim city manager and City Hall space behind them, several council members said there was little point in continuing to meet weekly until incorporation occurs. However, the council decided to begin the new schedule in November because agenda items have already been set for three Tuesdays in October.
