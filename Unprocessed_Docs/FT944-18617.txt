A survey of Italian visual arts in the postwar period opens at the
Guggenheim Museum on Friday. Entitled The Italian Metamorphosis 1943-68, the
exhibition focuses on a period when Italy became a leading exporter of
culture, and Italian design and style became synonymous with innovative
quality. It will include Arte Povera paintings, fashion designs by
Valentino, models of significant architectural monuments, artists' jewellery
and cinema.
