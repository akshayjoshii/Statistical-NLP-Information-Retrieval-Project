CZECHOSLOVAK President Vaclav Havel said yesterday he would be willing to
become president of an independent Czech republic if Czechoslovakia split
up, providing the conditions were right, Reuter reports from Prague.
Mr Havel failed to be re-elected as Czechoslovakia's federal president
recently after his candidacy was blocked by Slovak parliamentarians in the
country's new federal assembly. He said he would only accept nomination for
a post of active president, not a merely ceremonial figure.
The second round of the presidential election will take place on Thursday.
