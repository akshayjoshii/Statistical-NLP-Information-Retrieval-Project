Of all the industrial nations affected by this conflict, Japan, which imports virtually all of its oil, has the most to lose. Could it be possible that the United States is now fighting a war that was initiated by the greed of Kuwait and Japan? I believe that with Japan having the most to lose economically from this conflict that country should be one of the first to offer economic and military aid to achieve rapid resolution. To date, Japan has been conspicuously quiet.
