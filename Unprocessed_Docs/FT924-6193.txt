Colin Davies, one of the stock market's leading brewing analysts, is
quitting Barclays de Zoete Wedd and returning to Goldman Sachs. Davies, 42,
had been strategic planning manager at Whitbread before joining Fielding
Newson-Smith in 1985.
Goldman, which is rated ninth in this year's Extel ranking of brokerage
houses' research, has been looking for a brewing analyst for a year since
John Beaumont left to go to Smith New Court.
Elsewhere, another old Fielding hand, Kevin Feeny, 47, is joining Henderson
Crosthwaite institutional brokers (HCIB), as a drinks industry analyst.
Feeny left Warburgs earlier this year to make a bid - ultimately
unsuccessful - for some 300 pubs being sold by one of the national brewers.
Feeny (right) had joined the UK merchant bank as a brewing analyst but moved
when a team, led by John Spicer, arrived from Kleinwort Benson. He had
latterly been a director in the investor relations department.
