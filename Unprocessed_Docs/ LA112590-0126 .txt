Julian Jackson knocked out Herol Graham of Britain in the fourth round Saturday night to win the vacant World Boxing Council middleweight championship. 
Graham, the British middleweight champion, dominated the first three rounds, scoring with a variety of combinations and frustrating Jackson, who was missing wildly. 
But midway through the fourth round, when it appeared Graham (34-3) was in control, Jackson suddenly floored Graham with a short right hand. 
He was counted out by referee Joe Cortez of Atlantic City, N.J. Graham was on the canvas for more than five minutes. 
Jackson's victory gave him the WBC middleweight crown, vacant since Sugar Ray Leonard retired earlier this year. He also holds the World Boxing Assn. light middleweight crown. 
Jackson (42-1, 39 knockouts), from the U.S. Virgin Islands, scored his 34th consecutive knockout.
