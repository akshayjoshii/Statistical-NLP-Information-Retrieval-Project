TRANSPORT plans for Docklands received a further blow yesterday when it
emerged that the opening of the Beckton extension of the Docklands Light
Railway had been indefinitely postponed.
The setback comes on top of concern that the planned Pounds 1.7bn extension
of London Underground's Jubilee Line to Docklands could be jeopardised if
Olympia & York defaults on its Pounds 400m contribution.
The Pounds 256m Beckton extension of the DLR leaves the existing network at
Poplar and serves 11 stations on its route through Docklands on the north
side of the Thames. It had been due to open by the end of this year, but
that date could now slip to summer next year.
The postponement follows the transfer of responsibility for the railway from
London Transport to the London Docklands Development Corporation last month.
The new management has decided that it will not open the Beckton extension
to the public until it is satisfied that the computerised systems which run
the automatic train control systems are entirely trouble-free.
Services on the existing railway have been severely disrupted by teething
troubles with the newly-installed control system. 'We are not going to use
our passengers as guinea pigs,' the DLR said.
