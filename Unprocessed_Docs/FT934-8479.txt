North Korea yesterday condemned a joint US-South Korean military exercise,
saying it could trigger a war during a period of increased tensions on the
Korean peninsula, John Burton reports from Seoul.
It warned that South Korea and the US 'would be held wholly responsible for
the irretrievable consequences to be entailed by their provocative war
exercises against the North.'
