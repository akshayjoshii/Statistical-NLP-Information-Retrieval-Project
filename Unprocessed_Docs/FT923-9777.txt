MR Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary indicted last week on
criminal charges relating to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI) scandal, has won his request for the trial to be held unusually soon,
Alan Friedman writes from New York.
A Washington judge has set October 26 as the date of the trial of Mr
Clifford and Mr Robert Altman, his protege and law partner.
The two men were indicted in Washington and New York last week. The
Washington charges allege that they misled federal banking regulators about
their knowledge of BCCI's secret ownership of First American Bankshares, a
Washington bank they ran during the 1980s. Messrs Clifford and Altman have
entered pleas of not guilty in response to these charges.
The setting of an early Washington trial date is something of a tactical
victory for the two accused. Lawyers for both men argued for a quick trial
date, claiming that Mr Clifford, 85, might not live long and wished to clear
his name by winning a verdict in his favour.
But legal experts speculate there may be another advantage in being tried on
the Washington charges before having to face the indictments brought in New
York. The Washington charges are far less serious than those in New York;
these include conspiracy, the taking of bribes, falsifying business records
and scheming to commit fraud.
Under New York state law it is considered possible that 'double jeopardy'
provisions might mean a favourable verdict in Washington could preclude a
New York trial.
Another complication arising out of Mr Clifford's winning of an October
trial in Washington is that it might result in a delay of the separate and
unrelated trial of Mr Caspar Weinberger, the former Reagan administration
defence secretary indicted recently in the Iran/Contra scandal. This could
be because Mr Clifford and Mr Weinberger both have the same lawyer, who
might find it difficult to prepare simultaneously for the equally complex
Iran/Contra and BCCI trials.
