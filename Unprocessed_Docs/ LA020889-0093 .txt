Four nations searched Tuesday for a Norwegian cargo ship with a crew of four that vanished in the North Sea on Sunday. 
The 300-ton Stokksund was taking a cargo of sugar from London to Kristiansand, the Norwegian news agency NTB said Tuesday. It had been due to arrive Sunday when there were gale force winds across the North Sea.
