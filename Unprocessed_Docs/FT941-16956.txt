US officials yesterday expressed frustration with Japanese negotiators who
have been in Washington this week to advance measures agreed at the Tokyo
summit to reduce Japan's massive trade surplus.
Ms Joan Spero, undersecretary of state for economics, said the Japanese
negotiators were 'quite rigid', refusing to discuss quantitivate and
qualitative economic indicators agreed in the negotiating framework set in
Tokyo.
'They are totally resisting any serious dialogue in automotive and auto
parts issues,' she said. 'We don't see any progress.'
Japanese negotiators are insisting that the US 'make appropriate efforts
such as product development and introduction of suitable vehicles', such as
those with right hand-steering, to penetrate the Japanese market.
'In January 1992, Japanese motor vehicle manufacturers announced voluntary
plans including procurement figures,' according to a Japanese position
paper. 'However, the US has intentionally or unintentionally treated these
plans as a commitment backed by the Japanese government.
'In light of such experience, the Japanese government cannot further
encourage Japanese motor vehicle manufacturers to submit voluntary plans
with numerical projections.'
Japanese negotiators say that their government is undergoing extensive
reform and is eliminating excessive government intervention in the private
sector. 'Hence, it shall refrain from exerting influence over the purchase
of US auto parts by private business,' they say.
