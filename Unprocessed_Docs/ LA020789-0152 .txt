Air cargo has been banned from all domestic flights in and out of Tokyo's two airports for five days around the Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor Hirohito to prevent sabotage, transport officials said today. 
Transport Ministry officials said airlines and cargo companies were told only emergency items such as medicine would be exempt from the ban, set to begin on Feb. 22. "We have made the decision in view of the rush of international VIPs visiting for the funeral and to guard against bombs or explosive devices which may be concealed in air cargo by extremists," a ministry official said.
