Two baseball memorabilia dealers said they are being questioned by Internal Revenue Service and FBI agents as part of a federal grand jury inquiry to determine whether Pete Rose evaded income taxes. 
Baseball's investigation into Rose concluded this year that Charles Sotto had arranged for more than $32,000 in payments to Rose for signing autographs at memorabilia shows. 
"The IRS did talk to me," Sotto told the Cincinnati Post. "They wanted to know how much business I had done with Pete." 
Chuck Perkins, a memorabilia dealer who lives in Florence, Ky., said the FBI wanted to see a $5,000 check he had given Rose for a baseball card show in 1987 in Nashville, Tenn.
