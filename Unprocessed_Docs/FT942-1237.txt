Stephen Hyett, a 32-year-old butcher from Haverhill, Suffolk, pictured left
with his wife Tracy, says he feels fine after undergoing a 14-hour
multiple-organ transplant at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, in which he
received a new liver, kidney, stomach, duodenum, small bowel and pancreas.
He suffers from Gardner's Syndrome, a condition that can cause deadly
tumours in the bowel and duodenum.
