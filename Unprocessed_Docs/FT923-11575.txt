SOUTH Africa's role in the world trading system and its competitive
disadvantages after decades of ostracism are receiving close attention, with
the possibility of a 'demotion' to developing country status and membership
of preferential trading arrangements.
But the country would receive limited benefits from existing preference
systems, and might antagonise competitors in the developing world, according
to a study published yesterday by the Overseas Development Institute*.
The study argues that South Africa is not a typical developed country, with
many characteristics typical of a middle-income developing country such as
Brazil or Venezuela. As such, a strong case could be made for the country
being 'reclassified' as a developing country, and receiving a range of trade
benefits that go with that - including privileges under the General System
of Preferences (GSP) and the Lome Convention.
The study nevertheless argues that the gains from such a reclassification
would be limited. Most minerals on which it relies for almost three-quarters
of its export income are not subject to preferences - including gold, by far
the country's largest export earner. Main gains would be for fruits, metals,
paper and leather, while other exports potentially important to South Africa -such as coal, sugar, beef, steel and clothing - 'would be those least
available under preference schemes', the report says.
Membership of the Lome Convention would bring the greatest benefits,
including closer links with other economies in southern Africa. But this
would be difficult to negotiate because of fears of other Lome beneficiaries
