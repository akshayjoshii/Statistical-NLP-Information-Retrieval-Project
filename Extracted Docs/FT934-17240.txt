THE Federal Reserve Board has granted the Bank of Montreal powers to deal in commodity derivatives . The decision is expected to apply to other banks , writes Laurie Morse in Chicago . The Fed ruling will extend competition between banks and broker-dealers to non-financial futures and options . Prior to the Fed decision , banks were allowed to trade financial instruments on US futures and options exchanges , but were barred from clearing or servicing customer needs in exchange-traded energy or agricultural derivatives . The Fed said Chicago-based Harris Futures Corporation could execute trades and clear non-financial transactions at the US 's three largest futures exchanges . However , Harris will not be allowed to trade commodity futures and options for its own account , trade the physical commodities or offer commodities advice .
