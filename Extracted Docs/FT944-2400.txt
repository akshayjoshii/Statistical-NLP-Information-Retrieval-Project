John Walmsley , the former finance director at Enterprise Oil , the UK's largest independent oil explorer , has been appointed chief executive of Hardy Oil and Gas as from January 1 . He will succeed Peter Elwes , who will become deputy chairman with a full-time executive role . Elwes , who was Enterprise Oil 's first chief executive , interviewed Walmsley for his first job at Enterprise in 1984 . The two men say their long relationship should ensure a smooth transition . Elwes has been head of Hardy since 1989 , when the company was demerged from Trafalgar House . He is due to retire in 1996 . Walmsley was a director of Enterprise Oil from 1984 to 1993 and departed several months before Enterprise made its abortive bid for fellow explorer Lasmo . His appointment at Hardy ends almost a year of industry speculation about his future . Walmsley says there is unlikely to be any big shift in strategy at Hardy ; he intends to follow the philosophy he developed at Enterprise of focusing on core areas . In recent years the company has used the considerable cash generated by its extensive North American operations to fund longer-term projects in the UK sector of the North Sea .
