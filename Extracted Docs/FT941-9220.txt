Telephone price wars will take a new twist today as the Advertising Standards Authority upholds a complaint by British Telecommunications about Mercury claims . BT complained about two newspaper advertisements in which Mercury compared call charges in 1982 and 1993 . One stated that by 1993 Mercury had become 'best known for driving down the cost of everybody 's long distance and international calls by an average of 40 per cent ' . BT said the advertisement failed to acknowledge that other factors , such as tighter government controls over BT 's prices and changes in the regulation of international calls , had played a part in the reduction of charges . Mercury said only one ruling in 1991 by Oftel , the telecommunications regulator , concerning international calls , had directly affected BT's charges . The ASA said Mercury 'went too far in implying that Mercury was the sole reason for the reduction in BT 's call charges ' . The authority was happy , however , with the wording of another Mercury advertisement which stated that the company 'is known by . . . businesses . . . as the one who helped them reduce their phone bills ' . Mercury was also criticised by the ASA for failing to state clearly that the price comparisons had been adjusted for inflation . Beecham Group has been told by the ASA to state the sugar content of Ribena Sugar Free drink in future advertisements . The authority upheld A complaint by the pressure group Action and Information on Sugars about a poster for the drink which read : 'Sugar Free . Out Now . ' Beecham argued that after dilution as directed , the product contained 0.476g of sugar per 100ml , which counted as 'sugar-free ' under a draft EC directive .
