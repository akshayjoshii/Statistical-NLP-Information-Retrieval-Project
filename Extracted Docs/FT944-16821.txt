The Nobel Peace Prize committee , wracked by its worst dispute in two decades , has decided to give this year 's award to Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader Yassir Arafat , the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten reported yesterday , AP reports from Oslo . It said one committee member , Mr Kaare Kristiansen , a pro-Israeli former government minister , was so angered by the decision that he plans to resign in protest when the prize is announced in Oslo on Friday . The report appeared to break a tradition of secrecy before formal announcement of the most coveted of the Nobel Prizes . Each award is worth SKr7m ( Pounds 600,000 ) this year . Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin gave an impetus to Middle East peace with a handshake on the White House lawn on September 13 1993 . They then signed a declaration of principles on limited Palestinian self-rule as a first step toward an overall peace settlement . Aftenposten said the five-member committee struggled with its decision at a meeting last Friday over who should be honoured for achieving last year's Middle East peace breakthrough during secret talks in Norway . The newspaper said the committee might meet again in an attempt to patch up the dispute . The committee can change its mind until the last minute , but Aftenposten said this was unlikely as most members wanted Mr Arafat to share the prize . Aftenposten said Mr Kristiansen had opposed Mr Arafat throughout the selection process . He refused to confirm or deny the selection or his threat to resign . Editorial comment , Page 25
