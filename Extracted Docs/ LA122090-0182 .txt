The Utah town of Big Water was still in business Wednesday , the day after some of its citizens failed to get rid of their polygamist libertarian mayor when a measure to get rid of the town was voted down . The vote against disincorporation stood at 101 to 71 , including a dozen challenged votes , `` but with only 12 votes , it would n't have made any difference , '' said Dave Hansen , Utah 's deputy lieutenant governor . Hansen 's office joined the attorney general 's office in sending election monitors to Big Water after charges of illegal registration and vote fraud in a 1989 election deepened an abiding schism in this dusty retirement town of fewer than 400 people , where 54-year-old Alex Joseph has been mayor since the town incorporated in 1983 . The disincorporation election was not because of Joseph 's libertarian politics or even his polygamy -- as embarrassing as that is for the town 's image , said retired businessman Earl Tucker , a leader of the disincorporation campaign . Rather , it was over concern that Joseph , his nine wives and various relatives and friends were getting a `` stranglehold '' on the town , holding most public offices and local businesses , and doling out a good chunk of the town 's paying contract jobs to family or friends , Tucker said . Joseph said they do the jobs because no one else is willing or qualified .
