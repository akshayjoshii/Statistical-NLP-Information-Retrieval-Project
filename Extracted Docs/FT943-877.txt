Camas , the building materials group demerged from English China Clays in June , is paying Dollars 15.1m ( Pounds 9.5m ) for the majority assets of C & M Ready Mix Concrete of Boulder , Colorado . The assets comprise about 12m tons of proven aggregate reserves , which are situated north-east of Denver , five ready mixed plants and a fleet of concrete delivery trucks . In addition , Camas will receive Dollars 3m of income from trade contracts already undertaken . Mr Christopher Bailey , Camas finance director , said the deal would probably push the group into first position in the Denver ready mix market ahead of Redland . C & M reported operating profits of Dollars 1.5m in 1993 .
