The most senior US delegation to visit Burma in six years left Rangoon yesterday without any apparent promise of significant political reforms from the country 's military rulers . Mr Thomas Hubbard , US deputy assistant secretary of state , said after the two-day visit that moves by the junta towards political reconciliation would improve US-Burmese relations , but failure to make progress 'would lead to further restrictions on our political and economic ties ' . Mr Hubbard held talks with Lt Gen Khin Nyunt , head of military intelligence . The visit follows two meetings between Gen Khin Nyunt and Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , the democracy campaigner under house arrest in Rangoon for over five years .
