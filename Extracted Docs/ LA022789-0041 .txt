'' How do you know who 's an actress and who is n't ? You 're an actress if you 're acting . But you ca n't just walk up and down the room and act . Without that job and those lines to say , an actress is just like any ordinary girl trying not to look as scared as she feels . '' -- Andrea Leeds , '' Stage Door '' '' As an actor , no one could touch him . As a human being , no one wanted to touch him . '' -- Walter Matthau , '' The Sunshine Boys '' '' Kirk was wrong when he said I did n't know where movie scripts left off and life began . A script has to make sense , and life does n't . '' -- Humphrey Bogart , '' The Barefoot Contessa '' '' Congratulate Walter on his sets , Lucien on her costumes and Boris on his score . . . and tell the director he should have his head examined . He should n't have shot the picture ; he should have shot himself . '' -- Kirk Douglas , '' The Bad and the Beautiful '' '' Why do ( producers ) always look like unhappy rabbits ? '' -- Marilyn Monroe , '' All About Eve '' '' The last ( screenplay ) I wrote was about Okies in the Dust Bowl . You 'd never know because , when it reached the screen , the whole thing played on a torpedo boat . '' -- William Holden , '' Sunset Boulevard '' SOURCE : Harry Haun 's `` The Movie Quote Book ''
