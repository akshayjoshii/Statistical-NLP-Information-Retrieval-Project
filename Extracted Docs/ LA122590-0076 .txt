The U.N. trade embargo is depriving Iraqi civilians , including children , of critically needed medical supplies , a U.S. doctor who recently toured the region said Monday . `` We found that sanctions are working , and working brutally , right now , '' Dr. Bernard Lown of the Harvard University School of Public Health said in an interview on NBC-TV 's `` Today '' program . Baghdad hospitals , including pediatric hospitals , lack insulin , intravenous solution and injectable forms of other antibiotics and anesthestics , he said . However , the U.N. sanctions , imposed after Iraq 's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait , allow trade in medicine and some foodstuffs . Lown is co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War , which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985 .
