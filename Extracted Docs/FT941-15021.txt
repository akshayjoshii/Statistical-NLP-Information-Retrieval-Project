Negotiations over a Latin American assault on the European Union's controversial banana import regime are expected to continue today , with Latin American negotiators at odds with each other , and the European Commission alarmed that a breakdown will result in publication of a report damning its preferential trading arrangements with former colonies . Four of five Latin American banana exporters who brought a complaint against the EU banana import regime to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year agreed at a key meeting in Costa Rica last Thursday to bow to intense Union pressure to accept Europe 's proposed new banana import regime . However , the fifth - Guatemala - remains resolutely opposed to a settlement . It has won backing from Ecuador , Panama and Honduras , which are important banana exporters , but feel they have been sold short in a proposed European compromise because they are not members of Gatt . Consensus among the four Latin American countries willing to accept the EU compromise - Colombia , Costa Rica , Nicaragua and Venezuela - appeared fragile late yesterday , as it was reported that Nicaragua was unhappy that Costa Rica and Colombia were the main beneficiaries of compromise . The Latin Americans were warned in a letter signed by three EU commissioners last week that the Union 's new quota offer would not be improved , and would be withdrawn if it was not accepted before a Gatt panel report on the Latin American complaint is published . Gatt officials yesterday agreed to delay release of the report to this evening , two days after the deadline for publication , in an effort to allow negotiators to reach a compromise .
