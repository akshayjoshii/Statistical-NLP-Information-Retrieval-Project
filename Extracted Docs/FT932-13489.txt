THE US is likely to start high-level negotiations soon with Pyongyang in an attempt to solve the North Korea nuclear weapon issue , the South Korean government said yesterday . 'Negotiations are now under way ( to hold the talks ) and , as far as I know , the time is getting ripe , ' said Mr Lee Kyung-jae , the South Korean presidential spokesman . The announcement followed a visit to Seoul by Mr Peter Tarnoff , the US under-secretary of state for political affairs , who will represent the US in its discussions with North Korea . North Korea has long sought high-level contacts with the US as the first step to achieving diplomatic recognition by Washington . But Mr Tarnoff told the South Koreans that the forthcoming talks are a special event to solve the nuclear issue and do not represent a prelude to regular US-North Korean contacts . Contacts between the US and North Korea have usually been limited to meetings between consular officials in Beijing . Some western diplomats in Seoul , however , describe the proposed US talks as the first concession North Korea has won since its announced withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty last month . South Korea has been urging the US to hold direct talks with Pyongyang because it believes the meeting could persuade North Korea to reverse its withdrawal decision and accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency . It not seek direct talks with Pyongyang until the nuclear issue is resolved .
