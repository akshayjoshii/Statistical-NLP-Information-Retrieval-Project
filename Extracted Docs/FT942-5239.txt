Solo travellers on the Internet 'information highway ' are being overtaken by the digital equivalent of 16-wheel juggernaut trucks , as businesses begin to transport large quantities of data through cyberspace . The system is being transformed into a global electronic marketplace that could change the way world trade is conducted . The Internet , a global system of computer networks , now links an estimated 2.2m computers and over 25m users in 137 countries . New users are hooking up at the rate of about one every two minutes . Originally a US government-funded programme in the late 1960s , to electronically link researchers at US universities and government laboratories , the Internet was in theory closed to commercial activity until about two years ago . Now companies are rushing to take advantage of the system as a low-cost route for international electronic mail . Computer companies have led the way . Digital Equipment , one of the heaviest users , has over 31,000 computers linked to Internet and exchanges an average of 1.7m e-mail messages per month with people outside the company . To date , however , very little commerce is actually being transacted in cyberspace . Most companies have been reluctant to trust sensitive business data , purchase orders or credit information to the unregulated network . But that could be about to change . A group of Silicon Valley companies and organisations has joined forces in an attempt to pioneer the use of the Internet as a new medium for trade among high technology companies by creating an electronic marketplace called CommerceNet . If successful , this 'could revolutionise both regional and foreign trade ' , says Marty Tenenbaum , chief executive of Enterprise Integration Technologies ( EIT ) , a research firm leading the development of CommerceNet , together with Stanford University 's Center for Information Technology and the Western Research and Educational Network ( West Ren ) , a non-profit group that operates the Northern California portion of the Internet . The CommerceNet consortium is funded by a Dollars 6m US government grant , through the Department of Commerce ' Technology Reinvestment Program which is being expanded by the Clinton administration as part of its technology development policy . The group will obtain matching funds from the companies , state and local agencies that have agreed to sponsor the service . CommerceNet is tackling the problems that have discouraged companies from using the Internet for buying and selling goods and services , notably the complexity of navigating the Internet and lax security . The first problem can be overcome with a new 'point and click ' interface program called Mosaic , developed by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications ( NCSA ) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . Distributed free via the Internet , Mosaic is rapidly gaining popularity as an easy-to-use method to gain access to information resources on the Internet . Mosaic will enable companies to place 'virtual store fronts ' on the Internet . Buyers can tap into these store fronts , browse through catalogues of products - which may include pictures , diagrams and even video clips - call up order forms and transmit their orders directly to the seller . However , security remains a serious concern for business users . The public network is particularly vulnerable to computer 'crackers ' , as demonstrated by a recent rash of password interceptions involving tens of thousands of Internet users . To address this problem , EIT is working with RSA Data Security , the leading US encryption technology company , to develop a 'secure ' version of Mosaic . CommerceNet will provide participants with authentication , authorisation and data encryption programs so that buyers and sellers can safely exchange sensitive information such as credit card numbers and bid amounts , sign legally enforceable contracts , maintain audit trails , and get paid through co-operating banks . Until such software is available , CommerceNet participants will proceed cautiously . Most say they will provide on-line product catalogues and literature and enable orders to be placed via the Internet . For now , however , they will stop short of completing financial transactions . Nevertheless , CommerceNet is an important testbed for 'commerce in cyberspace ' , say participants . 'We expect to gain valuable insights and experience concerning electronic commerce , and to offer a broad range of business information and services via CommerceNet , ' says Peter Meekin , of Dun & Bradstreet . Hewlett-Packard and other manufacturing companies that are already using private networks for exchanging order information with their customers and suppliers see CommerceNet as a potentially cheaper alternative that could be used to expand their electronic selling activities . 'It will be another mode of electronic commerce , another tool in our tool kit , ' says Sandy Whitson , EDI business manager at HP . The company will move cautiously , she says , but is keen to explore the potential of public network electronic sales which could reach a broader range of customers than existing systems . While CommerceNet is currently focused on 'business-to-business ' transactions within a tightly-knit group of about two dozen companies , its founders have ambitious goals . ' I believe that in two to three years you will see as many as 100,000 companies using the Internet as a principal sales and service channel , ' says Tenenbaum . CommerceNet itself will be handling business transactions for as many as 3,000 companies by the turn of the century , he predicts . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Business booms in cyberspace -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Internet growth Date Hosts -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1969 4 04/71 23 16/74 62 03/77 111 08/81 213 05/82 235 08/83 562 10/84 1,024 10/85 1,961 02/86 2,308 11/86 5,089 12/87 28,174 07/88 33,000 10/88 56,000 01/89 80,000 07/89 130,000 10/89 159,000 10/90 313,000 01/91 376,000 07/91 535,000 10/91 617,000 01/92 727,000 04/92 890,000 07/92 992,000 10/92 1,136,000 01/93 1,313,000 04/93 1,486,000 07/93 1,776,000 10/93 2,056,000 01/94 2,217,000 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Source : Hobbes ' Internet Timelight Copyright , Robert H Zakon -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
