THE troubled financial empire controlled until last month by Canada's Belzberg family is being dismembered , writes Bernard Simon in Toronto . North American Life Assurance , a subsidiary of Security Life of Boston , is to acquire First City Trust from Harrowston Corp , previously known as First City Financial . First City Financial was the Belzbergs ' flagship company during their corporate-raiding heyday in the mid-1980s , but control was recently ceded to a group of Swiss bondholders as part of a financial restructuring . North American will invest CDollars 51m ( USDollars 43.9m ) in a new subsidiary , while the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation and Quebec Deposit Insurance Board will take up CDollars 175m in senior secured debentures . Under the deal , about CDollars 100m of First City 's debt and preferred share obligations will be eliminated . The new North American unit will recapitalise First City , which lost CDollars 115m in the first nine months of last year , mainly from leasing and equities investment . First City Trust , with assets of CDollars 3.9bn on June 30 1991 , is a mid-sized deposit-taking institution whose businesses include mortgages and fiduciary services . North American , with assets of CDollars 7bn , is the latest Canadian life insurance company to expand . It already offers real estate asset management , investment counselling and mutual fund services .
