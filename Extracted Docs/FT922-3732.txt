Members of Europe 's leading non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) last night met European environment ministers at the summit to call for stronger action on forest destruction and a commitment to work towards a worldwide forest convention , reports Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro . Forests , are one of the most contentious issues of the summit , and there has been little progress on bridging the north-south divide on the subject . With only one day of working group discussions left it seems unlikely there will be any agreement on deforestation which is continuing at a rate of 17m hectares a year . Mr Andrew Lees from Friends of the Earth said there was a danger the summit was losing sight of vital environmental problems because so much was being negotiated simultaneously in Rio . Forest devastation was continuing 'unhindered ' in the meantime . A convention had to be dropped long before the summit and replaced by a non-binding declaration of forest principles which says little other than that forests should be conserved and managed sustainably . Even this is causing controversy at the conference with developing countries , led by Malaysia , seeing it as an infringement of their sovereignty . NGOs argue that the declaration is so weak as to be almost worthless particularly as it includes no firm commitment to halt deforestation . The NGO demands presented to ministers last night include a commitment to follow up the principles with a legally binding instrument , and to allow signatories to set up national policies against trade in unsustainable forest products .
