Until recently , Gen. Manuel Noriega was an asset of the CIA , relied upon for assisting U.S. counterinsurgency operations in Central America . He has consistently been repressive and corrupt . Yet , only when he became a liability for U.S. policy in 1987 did the U.S. government turn against him . Now President Bush -- who as CIA director was aware of our relationship with Noriega -- authorizes the invasion of Panama to impose U.S. foreign ( and internal political ) interests once again . In stark contrast to the dramatic peaceful changes sweeping throughout Eastern Europe , Bush 's use of military force to overthrow Noriega sets a very bad profile for the United States . U.S. military forces should be withdrawn from Panama immediately , in favor of diplomatic actions by the United Nations or the Organization of American States .
