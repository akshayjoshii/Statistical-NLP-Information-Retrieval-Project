Wildflowers are starting to bloom earlier this year thanks to winter rains and recent high temperatures , according to the Theodore Payne Foundation , a nonprofit organization that perpetuates native California flora . The foundation 's hot line -- ( 818 ) 768-3533 -- informs which flowers are blooming and where they may be seen . The message is updated each Thursday through May 31 .
