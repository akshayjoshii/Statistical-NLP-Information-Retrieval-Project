The Nashville Network is not MTV for country-music fans . TNN 's mission is to be broader than MTV-to be the source in country music , entertainment and information and provide programs that reflect a country lifestyle . For all you city slickers , country music is `` taking a big breath of fresh Rocky Mountain air and fishing along the stream , '' said C. Paul Corbin , TNN director of programming . `` If you listen to the music and lyrics in country music you will find pretty well what a country lifestyle is . We want to make sure our programs are not the same that are available on the other networks . '' While MTV 's schedule still mainly consists of videos , TNN has 39 series , including flagship show `` Nashville Now , '' a live weeknight music-talk program hosted by Ralph Emery and a puppet named Shotgun Red . The show is celebrating its seventh anniversary . Other series include : `` Grand Ole Opry Live '' ; `` A Conversation with Dinah , '' a talk show hosted by Dinah Shore ; `` VideoPM , '' a three-hour weeknight music video show ; the how-to series `` Backyard America '' ; `` Cookin ' U.S.A. '' ; `` Country Kitchen '' with Florence Henderson ; and a celebrity interview series , `` Crook and Chase . '' Sports fanatics can catch more than 18 hours of auto racing , rodeos and fishing and hunting programs on Saturdays and Sundays . Responding to potential criticism from animal-rights activists , TNN general manager David Hall insists no animals are killed on-screen on the `` The Outdoorsmen '' and `` Celebrity Outdoors '' hunting series . `` We do n't kill Bambi , '' Hall said . `` We show the technique and theory ( of hunting ) . I have a real thing about that . If they are on a hunting expedition and they kill a great elk , it 's already ( happened ) by the time the camera gets there . '' Based on viewers ' reaction , Hall said , `` You can kill all the fish you want , but you ca n't kill Bambi . '' TNN is a division of Opryland U.S.A. Inc. of Nashville . The network began seven years ago as an 18-hour-a-day ad-supported cable service . `` We own the Grand Ole Opry , '' Hall said . `` Long before MTV , we had a good feeling for the loyalty and size of the country music audience and fans . We thought there was a large enough audience to support a cable TV network . '' TNN kicked off with a five-hour live music show from seven cities and came back the next morning with a game show , a sitcom , a concert music series and a live talk show . Every year , TNN provides 3,600 hours of original programming , including more than 1,100 live hours . `` People love live television , '' he said . `` I do n't know anyone who does a live variety show every month , '' Corbin said . `` 'Nashville Now ' is a phenomenal program . Our country artists can come and sing and Grandma and the kids can watch it without being embarrassed . '' To get a large viewer base , TNN was originally offered to cable systems for free for the first three years and was broadcast to 7 million households . Today TNN is the sixth-largest basic system with a subscriber base of 52 million households ; it 's in more than 210 markets and in every state . According to Hall , the network is turning a profit . TNN viewers generally are 25 or older , Corbin said . `` As a youngster , you may reject country music and go to rock music , '' he said , `` but in your late teens and early 20s , you take a look at life and your goals and your objectives and then all of a sudden , country music means something to you . After you reach the age of 25 , you are back into country , and it speaks to day to day emotions and frankly it deals with life and the way it is . '' TNN , he said , has helped boost the popularity of country music . `` Country record sales are just soaring , '' he said . `` This year there were 33 country albums which have been certified gold , platinum or multiplatinum . Particularly with new artists they are succeeding because they get exposure on TNN . '' `` I look on TNN very positively , '' said Gene Bridges , program director for Los Angeles country station KLAC-AM ( 540 ) . `` I do n't sit and watch record sales , but probably record sales have improved by exposure on TNN . I personally see it as a country music partner , helping us spread our message about country music . It 's my perception that country music is being accepted rapidly all over the world , particularly in the United States , and I think that TNN has helped do that . '' TNN tries to be a homespun cable service . `` We really are very much in tune with our audience , '' Corbin said . `` We really care about phone calls and letters . We respond to each and every letter . Sometimes they write back and we become pen pals . It is our way of doing things . We respect this audience and really admire them for their involvement . ''
