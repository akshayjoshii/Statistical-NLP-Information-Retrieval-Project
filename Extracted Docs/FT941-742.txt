Environment secretary Mr John Gummer yesterday opened the five-mile extension to the Docklands Light Railway to Beckton in east London after a delay of 18 months . The Pounds 280m project to extend the railway has been dogged by problems with construction and systems installation . The extension , which connects Beckton with the Isle of Dogs and the City , is funded by the London Docklands Development Corporation , set up to regenerate the old docks area . The extension takes the DLR to within a few hundred yards of the City airport in east London but , in a hangover from the poor transport planning which has bedevilled development of the area , there is still no station at the airport . Mr Gummer also launched the West Silvertown Urban Village , a development of 1,500 homes by Peabody Trust , the charitable housing provider , together with the LDDC , the local authority and Tate & Lyle , the sugar and sweeteners group . The scheme , based on the Prince of Wales ' ideas of integrated communities , is being backed by the government 's private finance initiative and will be built over eight to 10 years .
