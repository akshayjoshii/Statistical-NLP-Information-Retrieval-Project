Some microscopic bacteria and viruses are carcinogenic . Infections may account for 10-15 per cent of all cancers , according to epidemiologists at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund . Five kinds of germ have been identified as possible cancer triggers : Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium which survives in the stomach . It irritates the stomach lining which may respond with ulcers or cancer . Epstein-Barr virus is associated with Burkitt 's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma , cancers more common in central Africa and China respectively than in the west . EBV may be linked to cancer in people with suppressed immune systems , perhaps after an organ transplant . Human Papilloma virus ( HPV ) causes genital warts . Some sub-types have been linked to cervical and vaginal cancers . Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) survives for long periods in about 10 per cent of the population , who are then at increased risk from liver disease , including cancer . Human T-cell Lymphotropic viruses ( HTLV ) have been implicated in leukaemia in some populations such as Japan . In principle , antibiotics and vaccines can beat these infections . There are several hepatitis B vaccines on the market . Biotechnology companies , including Isis in the US and Cantab in the UK , and the UK's Cancer Research Campaign , are developing better HBV vaccines . The CRC says its vaccine might even help patients already with cancer . Work is being done too on broad spectrum antiviral drugs . California 's Gilead has a material which shows promise against EBV and HPV . And an industry is growing up around H pylori . Diagnostics companies are launching saliva tests to replace blood or tissue analysis , and Swedish drug company Astra this year won UK approval for an antibiotic-based ulcer treatment .
