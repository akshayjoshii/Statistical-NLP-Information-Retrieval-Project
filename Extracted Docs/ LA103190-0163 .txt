Scientists have pinpointed a rare , genetic flaw that makes people unusually sensitive to sunlight and predisposes them to skin cancer , it was reported today . A Japanese team headed by Kiyoji Tanaka at Osaka University said it has discovered and made copies of a gene that when defective causes the most common type of a disease called xeroderma pigmentosum . About one in 250,000 people suffer from xeroderma pigmentosum , an inherited disease in which skin cells lack the normal ability to repair the damage the sun 's ultraviolet light inflicts on genetic material . People with xeroderma pigmentosum must avoid exposure to sunlight . If they fail to do so , they run a high risk of developing skin cancer and potentially blinding growths on the eyelids and cornea .
