Wildlife officials in Alaska are confronting new problems related to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March . Recently , it has been discovered that some bald eagles have abandoned their nests , sometimes with oil-blotched eggs containing dead embryos , said U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service officials . Theories on why the birds are deserting their nests include the possibility that eagles scavenging on fouled shorelines may be getting their feathers soiled and spreading oil to their eggs , where it penetrates porous shells and kills unborn chicks . Or eagles may be frightened by cleanup crews working near their nests , experts said . Meanwhile , mother seals and pups are being coated with oil at rookeries . Even so , the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Coast Guard warned against capturing seal pups because they are better off with their mothers in the wild .
