Neighbors of a high-rise apartment building were kept away Monday while demolition experts worked out plans to bring down the building that would n't fall . `` We told you so , '' said a grass-roots neighborhood organization that had argued that the building and two others were solid enough to be renovated for low-income housing . More than 550 pounds of dynamite failed to bring the 36-year-old building down Sunday , although a second round of explosives knocked out the first two floors , leaving the main part of the building and a wing leaning against each other . The neighborhood organization , Project BASIC , had tried unsuccessfully in federal court to stop the demolition of the 10-story Hartford Park building , contending that it was structurally sound . `` Why did n't it fall ? That 's an open question , '' said David R. Evans , the explosives expert who coordinated the blasts . `` I knocked out the two floors I wanted to knock out and , by all indications , the building should have fallen . `` It 's the way it 's built , '' Evans said . `` It 's built like a honeycomb . '' The Providence Housing Authority decided to switch from explosives to a wrecking crane , which will begin work today , Director Stephen O'Rourke said . The process could take up to two weeks .
