SIKORSKY , the US helicopter maker , part of the United Technologies group , is studying with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan the development of a 19-seat civil helicopter , Paul Betts writes . The S-92 helicopter would be the first civil helicopter programme launched by Sikorsky since 1978 and would replace the S-61 the company produced between 1962-1981 . Mr Mike Baxter , Sikorsky 's vice-president of international and commercial business , said Mitsubishi had not yet committed itself to a joint venture . But Mitsubishi , a Sikorsky licensee during the past 30 years , has agreed to study the potential market . Sikorsky said other potential partners in Asia and Europe were interested . The US group is expected to decide whether to launch the programme by the end of this year . The US-led helicopter programme would compete against plans by Eurocopter , the new European helicopter group which has absorbed the helicopter activities of Aerospatiale of France and Germany's Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm , to develop a new version of Aerospatiale 's Super Puma helicopter , the Mark 2 . Sikorsky is expected to target the offshore oil industry for its new helicopter .
