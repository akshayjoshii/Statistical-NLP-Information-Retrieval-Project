Transplant doctors predict that pigs will become a main source of donor organs for people once the many technical problems of cross-species transplantation are resolved . While primates such as chimpanzees and baboons might be a better match , pigs are cheaper , more plentiful and easier to breed , says Dr. Hugh Auchincloss Jr. , assistant professor of surgery at Harvard University . `` What could change , I suppose , is that we could become better at making artificial organs than we are now . Then we would n't need the animal organs . But I do n't see that as coming first , '' Auchincloss said last week at the annual meeting of the American Society of Transplant Physicians . Only 50 to 60 chimpanzees are available in any given year for all types of research , Auchincloss said . `` It does n't make any sense to use chimpanzees because you 're going to make such a small impact in the well-being of humans . And you 'll make people so mad , because it is where they focus from the point of view of animal rights , understandably so , '' he said . `` If you can eat the pig , I 'm not sure you ca n't transplant the liver , '' said Arthur Caplan , director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota .
