How I wish the Lake View Terrace families wrenched by drug abuse could have joined me last summer at the Phoenix House rehabilitation center in Orange County ( Part I , May 27 ) . As an interim volunteer in the Nancy Reagan Center fund-raising effort , I researched long-term success rates and verified that prestigious nonprofit Phoenix House ranked among the best . But most convincing was the time I spent with the enthusiastic participants at the Santa Ana facility . They are clean-cut , clear-eyed testimony that the Phoenix House program works . For Lake View Terrace to be elated over the center 's defeat in their community is sad but conceivable . But for their city councilman , Ernani Bernardi , to call it `` a victory '' is sad and unconscionable . Phoenix House will no doubt take its outstanding program elsewhere now . What a loss for Los Angeles County . ANN FULTON Malibu
