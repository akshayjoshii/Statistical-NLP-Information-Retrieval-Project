Lower exceptional charges and interest costs helped DY Davies , the USM-quoted architect , cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 484,000 to Pounds 116,000 for the six months to October 31 . Mr David Davies , chairman , said that there had been a return of confidence in the property investment market but this had yet to be transferred to the property development or construction markets . He added that fee levels remained low as a result of competitive bidding and low demand . Turnover was 36 per cent lower at Pounds 2.5m ( Pounds 3.93m ) . Exceptional costs were down from Pounds 387,000 to Pounds 49,000 and interest payable was Pounds 110,000 ( Pounds 157,000 ) . Mr Davies said that exceptional items should continue to fall as vacant office space was let .
