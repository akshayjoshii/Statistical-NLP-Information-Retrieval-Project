The author of a controversial book about food and water contamination claims an industry-sponsored campaign used slanderous tactics to discredit his recent publication . Others say the negative outcry , regardless of origin , is scientifically justified . Either way , David Steinman 's `` Diet for a Poisoned Planet '' ( Harmony : $ 21.95 ) has generated more criticism than any other book of its kind . The phrases used to describe the work include `` trash , '' `` harmful to the health of any consumer '' and `` alarmist . '' Steinman became a target because he painted a bleak picture of how pesticide residues , chemical contaminants and other toxins are pervasive in the environment . He writes , for instance , that `` just eating the foods and drinking the water of late twentieth century America can kill you . '' A surprisingly diverse collection of groups have gone on record against the author , including the Bush Administration , the American Dietetic Assn. , the American Cancer Society , the Alliance for Food and Fiber , the American Council on Science and Health , and former surgeon general C. Everett Koop , who wrote `` I was amazed that any publisher would publish such trash . '' `` It 's remarkable how much effort food and chemical industries are making to squelch this book , '' said Michael Jacobson , executive director of the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest . `` Steinman made a sincere effort to alert people to problems in the food supply and -- whether or not I agree with him -- those problems deserve discussion and should not be shoved under the carpet by the food industry . '' Even before national distribution of the book 's 40,000 copies began , California Raisin Advisory Board lawyers requested that it be halted because Steinman `` misled '' readers when describing raisins as `` a highly pesticide-saturated food . '' Freshwater fish , processed meats , dairy products and conventionally grown produce are other foods considered dangerous by Steinman . `` Cows , pigs and other animals raised for slaughter concentrate toxins in their flesh from all the food they eat -- thousands of plants laced with chemical pesticides , '' the book states . Portions of `` Poisoned Planet '' use red , yellow and green lights to characterize the safety of individual foods . Some red-light victims : peanuts , bacon , hot dogs , veal , swordfish , lobster , eel , butter , milk chocolate , cheese , ice cream and whole milk . And in his most ambitious leap , Steinman maintains that diabetes , cancer , Parkinson 's , Alzheimers and other diseases are the `` consequences '' of exposure to chemical residues in foods . Critics complain that he writes about the total number of residues on certain foods , but he does n't discuss the actual level of these compounds present . For instance , using federal data Steinman states that as many as 97 chemical residues were found on 16 different peach samples between the years 1982 and 1986 . Yet he does not say at what level these compounds were detected nor how many were found on each piece of fruit . Neither is any mention made of whether the residues were present in parts per million or parts per billion . ( The federal government establishes Acceptable Daily Intake levels for each pesticide permitted for use on foods . ) In a recent interview , Steinman stood by all the controversial claims made in his book and came armed with volumes of data to support his contentions . He also tape-recorded the session -- for his `` protection , '' he said . Asked why he thinks `` Poisoned Planet '' has generated so much criticism , Steinman said it was because his approach to the subject differs from that of scientists . `` I 've painted food safety on a much larger canvas than scientists , who lose control of the subject when you paint food safety as a political and moral issue , '' he said . `` They ( scientists ) want to place ( the debate ) on risk alone but they do not deal with the issue in its entirety . '' Steinman was unrepentant about his use of terms such as `` drenched in pesticides , '' even though virtually all pesticide residues in food are found in parts per million or parts per billion. '' 'Saturated with pesticides ' is correct , exactly , '' he said . `` There are lots of safe foods and a few bad actors that I have highlighted ( in the book ) . . . . I 'm here to say that not all foods are created equal . There are clear patterns of contamination . '' Although there are no known causes or cures for Alzheimer 's disease , Steinman stands by his book 's claim that the presence of aluminum in cookware , foods and medicine `` may play the decisive role in the onset of Alzheimer 's . '' `` I 'm not aware of any nutritive value of aluminum in foods , '' Steinman said . `` No one has acquitted aluminum as a contributor to Alzheimer 's . It may not be a sole cause . . . but what 's the difference ? '' On the link between industrial pollution and pesticides triggering the onset of diabetes , Steinman said he could not give references for the association `` off hand . '' Nor did any diabetes research reference appear for the chapter in which the illness was discussed . While listing numerous sources in a `` Poison Planet '' appendix , Steinman rejected the use of footnotes in the book . As a result , his claims of cancer rates , pesticide residue calculations and other important scientific references are difficult to directly attribute . He said the use of footnotes would be `` tedious . '' `` I wrote this book for a lay audience , '' Steinman said . And Steinman 's reply to critics who claim `` Poisoned Planet '' is `` alarmist '' is `` the only ones alarmed by my book are those with a lot of money to lose if people stop eating pesticide- and chemical- ( laced ) food , '' he said . One of the most controversial points in `` Poisoned Planet '' is the author 's advocacy of `` detoxification , '' or a nutritional regimen designed to cleanse the body of contaminants with the aid of , among other things , niacin supplements . He specifically recommends a formal $ 3,000 detoxification program offered by HealthMed ( with clinics in Sacramento and Los Angeles ) . The basics of this detoxification formula were advanced in the 1950s by the late L. Ron Hubbard , Church of Scientology founder ; Steinman says that the California clinics are operated by practicing Scientologists although the directors have no formal connection with the church . Steinman , who denies any personal link with Scientology , says he himself has no religious affiliation . He says he would `` pray anywhere that they did n't ask him to pay . '' Steinman argues that several published research studies indicate that the cleansing does occur and can be accelerated through dietary changes , exercise and regular saunas . `` Some damage can be reversed . Not all , '' he said . `` We sweat out all sorts of chemicals . '' Recent research indicates that niacin supplements can cause liver damage , gout and elevated blood sugar in some people , but Steinman says that `` Poison Planet '' is explicit in saying that no one should take the vitamin without a doctor 's supervision . Steinman 's critics also question his statement that , `` Most people today have no conception of true mental clarity . We have all been exposed to low-level chemical residues for so long that it is difficult to conceive of life without their neurotoxic effects . '' But Steinman maintains that consumers ' exposure to low-levels of toxins does indeed affect the thought processes and cloud mental clarity . For example , he points to the known deleterious effects of lead poisoning in children . One such symptom is a slowed learning process . He said that by following his diet people will feel better both `` mentally and physically . '' Steinman has gotten some support from the medical community . Janette D. Sherman , an Alexandria , Va. physician , was asked by the book 's publishers to review `` Poisoned Planet '' once the scientific controversy ignited . She wrote a complimentary review stating that Steinman 's over-all approach is valid , his methods clear and his sources documented . However , Arthur L. Craigmill , a UC Davis toxicologist who reviewed the book for a food trade group , skewered `` Poison Planet . '' `` Borrowing some of the favorite terms of the author , the book is 'saturated ' with misinformation , 'laced ' with misconceptions and 'soaked ' in the selective presentation of outdated , unsubstantiated and anecdotal reports , '' Craigmill states . `` There are many serious flaws in Steinman 's approach . '' Steinman is undaunted , `` I 've said something simple , 'We have the right to control our exposure to toxic chemicals . ' ``
