Henson Film Applauded : The late Muppet creator Jim Henson 's movie `` The Witches , '' about a dastardly scheme to turn children into mice , won him posthumous plaudits Thursday from London critics . The movie stars Anjelica Huston as the head witch . `` It leaves us a testament to the glory that was Jim Henson , '' Nigel Andrews wrote in the Financial Times . Annabel Llywelyn-Cowper , who described herself as high priestess of two English covens , wrote in the Independent that the film 's effects were admirable but that it perpetuated the `` tired old theme ( of ) the witch as loathsome creature hellbent on destroying young lives . '' It opens in the United States in the fall . GREG BRAXTON
