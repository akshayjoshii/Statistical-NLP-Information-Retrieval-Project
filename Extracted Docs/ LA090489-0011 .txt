'' Floyd Jackson is the only person who knows what it 's like to be in my shoes , '' Brandon Tartikoff , president of NBC , once joked . The truth is , since he opened his shoeshine business at NBC studios in Burbank in 1951 , Jackson has worked on a lot of big shoes . `` I used to shine Bob Hope , Flip Wilson and Dinah Shore , '' said Jackson , who over the years has decorated the walls of his shoeshine stand with pictures of some of his most famous customers . After nearly 50 years of shining for the stars , Jackson himself has become something of a celebrity . `` Floyd 's Place '' is a regular stop on the NBC tour , and a booklet chronicling Jackson 's career at NBC is available at the studio gift shop . His regular clientele includes most of the guests who appear on `` The Tonight Show '' as well as the show 's star , Johnny Carson . Started in 1930s Now 80 , Jackson started shining shoes in the early 1930s at the swank Rice Hotel in Houston . Among his first celebrity customers was John Wayne . But many were Texas millionaires , such as former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Jesse H. Jones . Or oilman Glenn McCarthy , whose life inspired the best-selling novel `` Giant '' and the 1965 movie of the same title starring James Dean , Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson . It was McCarthy , Jackson said , who in 1947 offered to bring him to Los Angeles aboard his private airplane . The `` King of the Wildcatters , '' as McCarthy was known , had just built the $ 21-million , 18-story Shamrock Hotel in Houston and was coming to Hollywood to arrange for several movie stars to appear at the hotel 's grand opening , Jackson said . `` Glenn was one of the biggest fellas in Houston , '' Jackson said . `` He liked me to be around him because I had a sense of humor . '' Jackson said he and his family had been planning to move to the West Coast for awhile , and soon after arriving he sent for his wife , Corine , whose mother lived in Los Angeles . For a few years , Jackson carried a portable shoeshine stand all over Hollywood hunting down business . `` I used to go around to all the studios -- Warner Bros. , MGM , Universal Studios , ABC and NBC , '' he said . He also moonlighted as a custodian at Universal , a job he kept until 1971 . Stand at NBC Eventually , he saved enough money to buy a regular shine stand , which NBC allowed him to set up rent-free on the loading dock of the company 's old studios at Hollywood and Vine . When NBC moved from Hollywood to Burbank in 1951 , Jackson went along . Today , Floyd 's Place is located outside Studio One , where `` The Tonight Show '' is taped . `` One of the things Floyd is famous for is shining the shoes of all the people who appear on the 'Tonight Show , ' `` said NBC spokeswoman Pat Schultz . `` It 's become a good luck gesture for guests to have their shoes shined by Floyd before appearing on the show . '' The late night talk show 's entire cast , including Carson , are frequent customers , Jackson said . `` Johnny never comes out and gets his shine on the stand , '' Jackson said . `` Sometimes he 'll be in makeup , and I 'll come in and he 'll talk to me . Or I 'll go down and pick up his shoes in his dressing room and he 'll say , 'Howdy . ' He 's a good man . '' $ 100 Tip Jackson 's most famous customers have included former President Ronald Reagan and Frank Sinatra , who several years ago gave the shoeshine operator his first $ 100 tip . His second came last week -- from blues guitarist B . B . King . One of Jackson 's favorite stories is about the $ 99 tip he got from Spanish tenor Placido Domingo . `` He was getting a shine , and an NBC tour came by and told about Frank giving me a $ 100 , '' Jackson said . `` When Placido got off the stand , he said , 'Floyd , give me a dollar . ' So I gave him a dollar , and he handed me a $ 100 bill . '' The singer explained to Jackson : `` Me and Frank are very good friends , and I do n't want to out-tip Frank . '' Jackson said his worst tipper was former President Richard Nixon , who as vice president told his Secret Service escort to tip Jackson 50 cents . But Jackson said he does n't blame Nixon . `` I knew the vice president never carries money with him , '' Jackson said . Over the years , Jackson himself has appeared on television . He said he has been on `` Laugh-In , '' `` Real People '' and `` David Letterman , '' as well as `` The Tonight Show . '' No Stargazer In light of those experiences , Jackson said he is long past the stargazing stage and does n't get excited at meeting celebrities . But he has a warm place in his heart for those in the entertainment business . `` Show people are the greatest people on earth , '' Jackson said . `` I just love them . '' NBC executives say that over the years Jackson 's joviality has brightened the lives of studio employees . `` Floyd 's an institution , '' said Donald Zachary , vice president of NBC 's West Coast operations . `` He 's always got a smile and a good word for everybody . He 's well loved . '' Besides , Zachary said , `` NBC executives have the shiniest shoes in town . '' Although he retired officially last year , Jackson said he has had a hard time finding a reliable replacement . He works whenever he feels like it . NBC officials have promised Jackson that when he leaves , `` Floyd 's Place '' will remain a regular stop on the studio tour . `` I think about it , and you know I never heard of a shine man being a star , '' Jackson said . `` I 'm not bragging about it , but I made my own self a star .
