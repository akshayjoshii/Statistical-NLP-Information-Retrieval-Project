Thank God for Rep. Mel Levine ( `` Alaska Spill Energizes Vigilance in California , '' Op-Ed Page , May 8 ) and all your other writers , for keeping the horror and devastation of the Valdez oil spill alive and ticking before the public eye . Perhaps the public will eventually see what oil industry white lies and public apathy can do . It makes me disgusted and sad to see the animals , birds , and the marine life dying from the oil that was so carelessly spilled . It makes me raging mad that Exxon is so irresponsible about cleaning up the mess . I 'll bet they 're right on top of things when getting their oil leases from the government . In fact , Exxon action can be real swift . Recently Exxon agreed to give $ 4 million toward a public information campaign to offset the effects of the Valdez accident on Alaska 's tourism industry . When selfish or monetary reasons are at the core , action occurs , does n't it ? Thanks to Conrad , too . His cartoon on `` Whitewash '' ( May 8 ) describes it all to a T. DARLENE KURTZWEIL Whittier
