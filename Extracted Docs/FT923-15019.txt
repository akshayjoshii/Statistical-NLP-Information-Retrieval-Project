Sir , You report on June 30 ( 'Pension age for women may rise ' ) that the government is moving in favour of equalising the state pension age at 65 ; a flexible decade of retirement has apparently been ruled out . You discuss the options solely in terms of benefits - or losses - to the exchequer . This is precisely a reflection of the narrowness of government thinking . The state pension age is critical in influencing individuals' retirement decisions . A fixed state pension age encourages employees to think in terms of an arbitrary and absolute end to their working lives . This is at odds with the trend in working patterns , where flexibility is paramount . A flexible decade of retirement would allow and encourage employees actively to think about a range of options rather than perpetuating the damaging belief that full-time work should end at 65 .
