Former President Richard Nixon said today that the fact that he resigned will always be a part of his presidency but that down the road the people , rather than the historians , will remember that he made a difference in the quest for world peace . In an interview with host Bryant Gumbel on NBC 's `` Today , '' Nixon , who resigned in 1974 rather than face impeachment on charges related to the Watergate scandal , was asked what historians will write about his presidency . `` Well , what historians will write and what history in the broader sense may conclude could be very different , '' Nixon responded . Nixon said he will be remembered for making a difference `` as far as our relations with China are concerned and in initiating a new relationship with the Soviet Union , in saving Israel with an airlift in 1973 , in ending the Vietnam War , ending the draft . I think those events will be remembered . But , he added , `` Of course , I 'm doing a little wishful thinking here , I know , and I would not suggest that historians , the current crop , would ever reach that conclusion . '' As for his own resurgence in the public light , Nixon was asked to reflect on his own words when he said public sympathy comes to even the most controversial with the onset of old age . `` Well , it depends on what the public is , '' said the 77-year-old Nixon . `` Some of the public say , 'My God , is the man ever going to die ? ' And all they 're interested in is reading my obituary . And then there are others who are amazed I 'm still alive . `` As far as I 'm concerned , what I hope is that my life , in addition to being examples that you can make a difference if you set your mind to it in public leadership , what I hope is that people will remember that I lived by the rule : Never give up . Never look back . Always look forward . And if that is the lesson that young people can get from my life , it will have all been worthwhile . Never give up . ''
