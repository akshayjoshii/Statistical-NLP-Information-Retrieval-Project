CBS may have ended last season in third place , but its surprise hit , the Western miniseries `` Lonesome Dove , '' not-so-surprisingly netted the most nominations Thursday for the 41st annual nighttime Emmy Awards , topping by one the most nominated show of the last two seasons , `` L.A . Law . '' `` Lonesome Dove , '' the critically acclaimed , eight-hour adaptation of Larry McMurtry 's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel , garnered 18 nominations -- including one as best miniseries and others for stars Tommy Lee Jones , Robert Duvall , Diane Lane and Anjelica Huston . Its showing pushed CBS to a strong second place among the nomination leaders . Ratings king NBC , which has dominated the Emmy nominations for the last six years , collected 103 of the 364 nominations , with CBS getting 95 and ABC 85 . PBS programs netted 32 , and syndicated programs got 21 nominations . Fox Broadcasting shows got 12 . Cable programs , which became eligible for nomination for the first time last year , received 16 nominations , only one more than last year . Suzanne de Passe , co-executive producer of `` Lonesome Dove '' and president of Motown Productions , said Thursday that when she got the 6 a.m. call from the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences informing her of the 18 nominations , `` I immediately burst into tears . `` It 's probably the most satisfying moment I think I 've ever had . . . , '' she said . `` I 'm so thrilled -- not just for the actors and what they call the major categories , but for our costumer , all of the people who really gave it all of that look , the photography , the music . For me as a producer and as part of the producing team , it really means we selected great people . '' De Passe added that the multiple nominations will not affect Motown 's decision on whether to produce a sequel to what was the highest rated miniseries of the last five years . That depends , she said , on whether author McMurtry endorses it . `` It 's the only way I would be happy ( doing a sequel ) , '' she said . Last year 's best series winners -- ABC 's `` thirtysomething '' in drama and ABC 's `` The Wonder Years '' in comedy -- were nominated in those categories again and also picked up more total nominations than in their first year on the air . `` thirtysomething '' got 13 , compared to its 1988 total of 10 , while `` The Wonder Years , '' which received only two nominations in 1988 -- in the series and writing categories -- garnered 14 this time out . CBS newcomer `` Murphy Brown , '' starring Candice Bergen as a hard-driving TV newswoman , became the most-nominated new series of last season with 11 nominations . But the series faces stiff competition in the best comedy category : Other nominees include previous Emmy-winners `` The Wonder Years , '' NBC 's `` Golden Girls '' and NBC 's `` Cheers , '' along with CBS ' `` Designing Women . '' `` We 're thrilled , we 're just thrilled , '' said Diane English , co-executive producer of `` Murphy Brown '' with husband Joel Shukovsky . `` A part of me would like to be the kind of person who says , 'It means nothing ; I do n't care , ' but let 's be honest : This is pretty great -- especially since we 're such a new show . '' English acknowledged that the thrill of being nominated is tempered by the waiting period between now and the Emmy Awards ceremony , which will be held Sept. 17 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium . `` Now is the part when it 's not so much fun , where people try to involve you in that competition , and it really should n't be that , '' she said . `` It would be great if it did n't come down to one winner , because the stuff that gets nominated is all so good . It would be great if it just ended here -- that these are the five best shows in each category . '' `` Murphy Brown '' has been only a marginal ratings success for CBS -- but ratings do n't necessarily translate into Emmy nominations . The three top-rated series of last season received only six nominations among them -- four for ABC 's `` Roseanne '' and one each for NBC 's Thursday-night tandem of `` The Cosby Show '' and `` A Diffent World '' -- and none was nominated as best comedy series . The star of `` Roseanne , '' former stand-up comedian Roseanne Barr , also failed to win nomination as best actress in a comedy series , although John Goodman , who plays her husband , was nominated as best actor . Also notably absent among the comedy nominees was John Larroquette of `` Night Court , '' who has won the Emmy as best supporting actor for four years in a row . But while Barr was an entrant in the competition , Larroquette was not : The actor took advantage of a new Emmy rule that requires actors to enter themselves in the competition , as do producers , writers and entrants in all other categories . In previous years , the producers of the shows were allowed to enter their cast members in the acting categories . Larroquette said Thursday that he chose not to enter . `` I think my thought process was that the generosity of the Academy toward me has been magnanimous , and I just felt that I did n't want to overstay my welcome , '' he said . `` I do n't think there was any real devious thought about it , such as , ' I 've never lost and I do n't want to lose now . ' `` Along with the `` Murphy Brown '' nomination as best comedy , CBS scored another coup in the best drama category with its second-season series `` Wiseguy , '' the story of undercover agent Vinnie Terranova ( Ken Wahl ) . Other best drama nominees were ABC 's `` China Beach , '' CBS ' `` Beauty and the Beast , '' NBC 's `` L.A. Law '' and ABC 's `` thirtysomething . '' Wahl also found a place among the nominated lead actors in a drama series , along with Ron Perlman of `` Beauty and the Beast , '' Edward Woodward of `` The Equalizer , '' Carroll O'Connor of `` In The Heat of the Night '' and Michael Tucker of `` L.A . Law . '' Lead actresses nominated in the drama category were Linda Hamilton of `` Beauty and the Beast , '' Dana Delany of `` China Beach , '' Susan Dey and Jill Eikenberry of `` L.A. Law , '' and Angela Lansbury of `` Murder , She Wrote . '' Several special programs and movies received multiple nominations . `` My Name Is Bill W. , '' ABC 's dramatization of the life of the man who started Alcoholics Anonymous , got 7 , including an acting nomination for James Woods . NBC 's controversial `` Roe vs. Wade , '' the story of the landmark abortion case , got 6 nominations , among them nods for outstanding lead actress in a miniseries or special for Holly Hunter and Amy Madigan . The PBS `` Great Performances '' installment `` Dance In America : Gregory Hines Tap Dance in America '' won five nominations ; HBO 's `` Murderers Among Us : The Simon Wiesenthal Story '' got three . On the late-night front , newcomer Arsenio Hall may not be beating competitors Johnny Carson and David Letterman in the ratings yet , but he got more Emmy nominations : `` The Arsenio Hall Show '' got three , and Carson and Letterman got only two .
