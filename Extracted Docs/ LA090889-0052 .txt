Exxon Corp. abruptly ceased its wildlife rescue and collection efforts off environmentally battered Kodiak Island , Alaska , despite a new wave of bird deaths there . The firm had already been under fire for deciding to end the overall cleanup of its March 24 oil spill by mid-September . The early quitting date at the start of the fall bird migration surprised and angered the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service , said Paul Burke , assistant spill coordinator for the agency in Kodiak . There has been no official response to the criticism from Exxon . `` We are considering a response , '' said Ann Frechette , an Exxon spokeswoman in Valdez .
