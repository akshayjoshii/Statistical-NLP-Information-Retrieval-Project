SOUTH KOREA yesterday indicated that it would adopt a tougher attitude on the North Korean nuclear issue after Pyongyang rejected a proposal by Seoul to resume talks on mutual nuclear inspections . 'We gave everything we could give at the last round of North Korea-US high-level talks . Now it 's time to show Pyongyang what sticks are in store , ' said Mr Han Sung-joo , the South Korean foreign minister . During its discussions with the US last month , North Korea was offered improved relations with Washington and the supply of safer light-water reactors to replace its graphite-moderated ones if it accepted full nuclear inspections by South Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) . The IAEA wants to examine sites to determine if North Korea is reprocessing more plutonium than it has disclosed , for possible use in developing nuclear weapons . North Korea said on Monday that it rejected holding talks with the South through the bilateral Joint Nuclear Control Commission and instead insisted that the dispute about Pyongyang 's nuclear programme be linked to a summit meeting between the presidents of the two Koreas . Seoul refuses the Pyongyang demand for a summit , calling it 'premature' until the nuclear dispute is resolved . Both the US and South Korea have suggested that they may ask the UN Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea by the end of September unless Pyongyang shows results in talks with the IAEA and South Korea on the nuclear issue . IAEA inspectors yesterday completed maintenance work on monitoring equipment installed at North Korea 's Yongbyon nuclear complex . But the IAEA is still barred from two nuclear waste sites . The IAEA demand to view these sites triggered North Korea 's announcement last March that it was withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , although it later suspended the threatened action after holding talks with the US .
