Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne named Mike Grant as his starting quarterback for the Citrus Bowl game Tuesday in Orlando , Fla. , against Georgia Tech . Osborne chose Grant over Tom Haase after Mickey Joseph suffered a severe leg laceration in the last game of the regular season against Oklahoma . Grant was Nebraska 's starter in the season opener against Baylor but had a bruised knee that cost him the next two games . He returned as the starter in the fourth and fifth games but was then replaced by Joseph the rest of the regular season . `` It does n't matter who the quarterback is , you 've still got to stop their offense , '' Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross said . `` He 's ( Grant ) a great football player and has a good arm . He 's a better thrower than Joseph . '' JOHN CHERWA
