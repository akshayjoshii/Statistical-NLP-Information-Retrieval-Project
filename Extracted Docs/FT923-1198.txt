MEDICAL consultants can earn six times their National Health Service salary by carrying out equivalent work in the private sector , a study by Laing and Buisson , health care consultants , said yesterday . The analysis , sponsored by Norwich Union Healthcare , one of the UK 's largest private health insurers , concluded that private specialists ' fees were substantially above 'necessary ' levels and had risen sharply in the past few years . It estimates that 12,000 of Britain 's 19,000 NHS consultants conduct private work , and that on average such specialists will earn about Pounds 95,000 this year . Consultants ' net income from private practice as a proportion of total earnings including that from the NHS has risen from 15 per cent in 1975 to 31 per cent in 1990 . The report says a specialist occupied full-time in private practice charging at limits set by Bupa , the health insurer , would earn Pounds 300,000-Pounds 340,000 . The Monopolies and Mergers Commission announced an inquiry this month into fees charged by consultants .
