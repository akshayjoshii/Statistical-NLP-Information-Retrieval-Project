George Bush is going to be a one-term President . People will vote their pocketbooks in 1992 , as they have in about 48 of the 50 presidential elections we 've had so far . If things are looking up , the ones who make the difference will stick with what they 've got , which has been the Republicans for more than 10 years now . If things are bad , they 'll change -- and put in a Democrat . It looks as if things will be bad . The savings and loans are gone with a lot of our money . Real estate prices are collapsing , trapping sellers in their homes or forcing them to default . The cycle of mortgage foreclosures and no buyers will soon enough lead to bank failures around the country . A political analyst named Bush said in 1988 -- this was one of the true things he said -- that for the Democrats to do well , America has to do badly . That appears to be happening now in 1990 . Well , bad luck for Bush . He has been an extraordinarily lucky candidate and President up to now . But in 1992 , a lot of voters will abandon him . That is not because they like Democrats , or any particular Democrat , all that well . Nor do they particularly like politics or government , either . But it is becoming obvious to almost everybody that this bunch of Republicans did not really want to stop what government does ; they just wanted to control what it did or did not do . They did that and failed miserably at a lot of it .
