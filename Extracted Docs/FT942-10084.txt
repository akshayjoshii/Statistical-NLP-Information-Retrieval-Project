BhS , the retail store chain , either cares naught for product placement or has never heard of Britain 's biggest union . The public services union , Unison - which has 1.5m members - is celebrating the discovery of its own name splashed across a whole range of BhS children 's clothing . Could this be a brand new marketing opportunity ? The union gets free advertising , and BhS can tout its wares among Unison members keen to identify with their offspring . Where will it all end ? NUT caps or Cohse sweaters ?
