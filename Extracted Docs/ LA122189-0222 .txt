Author Norman Mailer is upset about a line in the new one-man Broadway play `` Tru '' that alludes to a 29-year-old incident in which the writer allegedly stabbed his wife . Mailer said in a letter to co-producer Lewis Allen that the reference was `` kind of crass , '' according to today 's editions of the New York Times . `` It 's an ugly line designed to cater to rich out-of-town yahoos , '' Mailer wrote to Allen , who also is husband of the playwright , Jay Presson Allen . The line that irked Mailer is spoken in the first act by the Truman Capote character , who is worried about his popularity in 1975 after a story of his was published in Esquire magazine . Capote , played by Robert Morse , is talking on the telephone and tells his lecture agent 's secretary : '' Listen , hon . When Irene gets back in , ask her when Norman Mailer stabbed his wife , how much his fee went up . '' The line refers to when Mailer allegedly stabbed his second wife , Adele Morales , with a penknife after an all-night party at his Manhattan apartment in November , 1960 . She declined to press charges . In reply , Lewis Allen wrote Mailer : `` A pretty poor show , kid , for someone who over three decades has assiduously worked at creating the very public image of a provocateur , a tough guy who takes on all comers , a mythic brawler . `` But when a small shot comes your way , you toss your curls and sob 'foul .
