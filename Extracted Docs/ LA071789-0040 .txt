Rough seas have caused further damage to the tanker Exxon Valdez , which continues to leak small amounts of an unidentified substance into the ocean off San Diego , the U.S. Coast Guard said . Heavy seas bent back three more steel plates from the tanker 's bottom , bringing the total to nine , Coast Guard Lt. Ed Bass said . The jagged steel plates hanging from the tanker 's bottom make its draft too deep for San Diego 's port where the Valdez was being towed for repairs . The Exxon tanker , which caused the worst oil spill ever in the United States when it ran aground in Alaska in March , has been towed to calmer waters about 20 miles off San Clemente Island , Bass said . Despite the new damage , the vessel is still structurally sound , an Exxon spokeswoman said .
