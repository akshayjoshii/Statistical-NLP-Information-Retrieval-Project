THE NUMBER of banks involved in financing international commodity transactions in London has fallen to just a dozen from about 30 over the past 2 1/2 years , a London conference was told this week . 'This rapid fall-out of banks has caused some of the commodity trading companies in the industry considerable pain and has even meant ultimate demise on occasions , ' Mr Guy Saunders , senior manager , commodity and trade finance at ANZ Bank , told the conference , organised by Moores Rowland , the accountancy firm , in association with World Commodity Report . The cut in the number of successful commodity traders companies and banks committed to the industry meant 'the past few years have been extremely turbulent and unstable from a financial perspective . ' But he thought that the remaining banks would continue to support the industry .
