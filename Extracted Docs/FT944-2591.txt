Philippine debt negotiators yesterday haggled with a visiting International Monetary Fund review team over the fine points of what appeared to be a 'tacit ' agreement on increased monetary expansion ceilings in the country's economic programme . The Philippine government wants to aim for a higher overall economic growth target without being hemmed in by tight liquidity and inflation ceilings . Mr Gabriel Singson , governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas , the country 's central monetary authority , said the visiting IMF team had agreed there will be some relaxation on monetary aggregates for 1995 . However , Philippine panel member Mr Roberto de Ocampo , finance secretary , earlier told journalists the IMF had asked for 'more evidence' from government negotiators to support the request for new ceilings .
