Rogers Communications faces a long wait for Canadian regulatory approval of its CDollars 3bn ( USDollars 2.2bn ) strategic merger with Maclean Hunter . Both the federal Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) and the Bureau of Competition must review the deal , as Rogers is Canada's biggest cable-TV operator and Maclean Hunter the second largest . Maclean Hunter also holds extensive print media interests . Federal industry minister Mr John Manley said : 'It is by no means clear the takeover creates unacceptable media concentration and some argue that Canada needs the critical mass to compete with the giant US multimedia conglomerates . ' Mr Phil Lind , vice-chairman of Rogers , said he did not expect the CRTC decision until early 1995 , and a trustee would technically run the merged business until then . Rogers can not complete the sale of any parts of Maclean Hunter , such as the publishing and commercial printing units , until the CRTC makes its decision . In the past , the CRTC decisions have leaned towards preventing any single company from dominating the domestic cable industry . The Competition Bureau 's position will depend heavily on the CRTC decision . Rogers won the Maclean Hunter board 's approval of its CDollars 17.50-a-share cash offer for all the Maclean Hunter shares it does not already own . It also got an option on 17.4m Maclean Hunter treasury shares at the same price . The expiry date was extended to March 31 from March 15 to allow time for the US Federal Communications Commission to rule on Rogers ' proposal to sell Maclean Hunter 's US cable licences for about CDollars 1.5bn . This was designed to reduce Rogers ' heavy debt load . The enlarged Rogers would have 33 per cent of the total Canadian cable subscriber base , up from 23.5 per cent before the deal . The big US cable operator TeleCommunications has 10m subscribers .
