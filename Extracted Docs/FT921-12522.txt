NATIONAL WESTMINSTER , second-largest of the 'big four ' clearing banks , yesterday cut its mortgage interest rate from 11.55 per cent to 10.99 per cent , David Barchard writes . The reduction matched last week 's cuts by Abbey National bank and several large building societies . Several other large banks said they were keeping their mortgage interest rates under review but had no immediate plans to make a cut . Lloyds said it would review its rate at the weekend .
