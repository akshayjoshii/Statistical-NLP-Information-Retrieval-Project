With all the press given to turning George AFB into a major commercial airport ( Col. One , Aug. 26 ) complete with high-speed rail links , it makes me wonder if there is n't a better near-term use for this site . Why does n't the Pentagon relocate the Marines from El Toro MCAS to George AFB ? This would keep George a military air base for which it was designed and allow El Toro to be used as Orange County 's much-needed , Los Angeles-reliever airport . George AFB is much larger than El Toro , is far closer to the Marine Corps facilities at Twenty-Nine Palms and Fort Irwin , and is still only 65 air miles from El Toro if close proximity to Camp Pendleton is a must . Using George AFB as a commercial airport may make sense for the year 2000 and beyond . However , using El Toro MCAS as Orange County 's commercial airport makes sense now . GORDON G.
