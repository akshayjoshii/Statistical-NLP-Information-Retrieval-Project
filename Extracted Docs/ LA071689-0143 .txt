William B. Critchfield , a pioneer and leading expert on forest genetics , died of a heart attack Tuesday in San Francisco . He was 65 . Before his retirement last year from the U.S. Forest Service , Critchfield 's work in identifying and establishing relationships among tree species was considered a breakthrough . `` He was one of the first to try to understand the role of genetic factors in the evolution of pine trees , '' said Connie Miller , who took over Critchfield 's post at the Forest Service 's Berkeley station . `` Before that , work had been done on plants and animals , but not trees . '' His 1966 book , `` Geographic Distribution of Pines of the World , '' continues to be considered the definitive text on the subject . He was internationally known for his work on pine tree evolution and frequently did consulting work in other nations . He also worked closely with the University of California 's Forestry Department , helping graduate students with their careers . Miller said that future work on the so-called greenhouse effect will build on Critchfield 's findings . The Minnesota-born Critchfield grew up in North Dakota , and the story of his family 's struggle during the Great Depression was recounted by his brother , Richard Critchfield , in the book , `` Those Days , '' published in 1985 . Critchfield attended North Dakota Agricultural College before serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II . He received his doctorate from the University of California , and was on the Harvard research faculty before joining the Forest Service and returning to Berkeley . Survivors include two brothers and a sister . Services will be held Monday in Berkeley .
