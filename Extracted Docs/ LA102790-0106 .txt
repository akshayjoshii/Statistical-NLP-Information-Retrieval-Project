Sean Boldt 's controversial 29-yard touchdown reception with 5 minutes 52 seconds left capped El Camino Real High 's 14-7 comeback victory over Reseda in a Northwest Valley Conference game Friday night at Reseda . With El Camino Real facing fourth and 21 at the 29 , quarterback Evan Howland threw to Boldt , who broke from two Regent defenders and made the reception as he rolled over in the corner of the end zone . `` We were very fortunate to win tonight , '' El Camino Real Coach Mike Maio said . Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer saw the game 's deciding play differently . `` The man pushed off . It was obvious offensive pass interference , '' Schaeffer said . `` My two kids both said ( Boldt ) trapped the ball . The referee said otherwise . It 's a tough way to lose a ball game . '' Reseda ( 3-3 , 1-3 in league play ) opened the scoring after Maurice Stepter intercepted a Howland pass in the first quarter . A seven-play , 18-yard drive aided by a 15-yard roughing the kicker penalty on a field-goal attempt was capped by Stepter 's four-yard scoring run . El Camino Real tied the score after junior defensive tackle Herbert Cosey recovered a Reseda fumble at the Regent 19 . Three plays later , Chris Griggs ran for a 10-yard touchdown to tie the score at 7-7 . El Camino Real ( 5-1 , 3-1 ) limited Reseda to 23 yards . Griggs led El Camino Real with 83 yards in 17 carries and backfield mate Ryan Marine carried 24 times for 83 yards . GARY HYNES
