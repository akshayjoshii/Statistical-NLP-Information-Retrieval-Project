THREE new approaches to cancer treatment are giving promising results in early clinical tests , an oncology conference in London was told yesterday . All three result from collaborative research involving Scotia Pharmaceuticals , a UK-Canadian drug company , and university medical centres in the UK and overseas . Potentially the most far-reaching treatment is a tumour-killing drug , EF13 , which Scotia described as a 'magic bullet ' which could destroy cancer cells without harming normal tissues . Preliminary clinical trials indicate that the drug may double the survival time of patients with late-stage pancreatic and breast cancers . The doctors involved , however , are wary of making extravagant claims for what is still an experimental drug . 'EF13 seems to have important therapeutic effects without harming the patients , ' said Mr Ken Fearon from Edinburgh University 's department of surgery . 'It really is different from anything else available . ' Dr David Horrobin , Scotia chief executive , said EF13 was developed not to be a more potent cell killer than other cancer drugs but to be free of the toxic side effects which make conventional chemotherapy so unpleasant . It is similar chemically to Evening Primrose Oil which has until recently been the main source of income for his company . The second new drug , EF27 , reduces the harmful effects of radiotherapy . Trials by the Radiobiology Research Group at Oxford 's Churchill Hospital show that the drug can protect normal tissue from radiation damage while enhancing the damage caused to cancer cells . The third drug , EF9 , is a light-activated chemical designed to improve a form of cancer treatment known as photodynamic therapy . EF9 destroys cancer cells when the tumour is illuminated by laser . If the treatments continue to show promise they could be available commercially within three or four years .
