The deal is worth about Dollars 175m . Fox , based in Perrysburg , Ohio , specialises in database software , used to organise libraries of data and retrieve information .

Microsoft 's stock remained relatively steady , fluctuating between Dollars 128.75 and Dollars 129.87 Microsoft will combine its own development team with the Fox group at Microsoft 's headquarters near Seattle , Washington .

Mr Gates said : 'We soon will be able to offer customers a complete family of superior scalable database applications and development environments . ' Mr David Fulton , Fox 's president , will join Microsoft to head its recently-created database software division .
