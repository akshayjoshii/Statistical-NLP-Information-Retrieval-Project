Some victims of Lyme disease may suffer memory loss , mood changes , tingling sensations , shooting pains and other signs of nerve damage that strike years after the initial tick bite , scientists have found . Antibiotic therapy can often relieve these lingering symptoms , although recovery is seldom complete . `` This is similar to syphilis , '' said Dr. Allen C. Steere . `` Although the neurological symptoms and consequences are different , in both diseases there are long periods of latent infection in the brain followed by a variety of neurological disorders . '' The doctors cautioned that only a few Lyme patients suffer this lingering nerve disorder , and most can be cured with antibiotics given early during their infections . Steere , who first recognized the disease in Old Lyme , Conn. , about 15 years ago , was senior author of the latest report , written with two colleagues at New England Medical Center in Boston . It was published in last week 's New England Journal of Medicine . Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by tiny ticks that are usually carried by deer and mice . It is common throughout the Northeast , Midwest and California . Usually , the first sign of Lyme disease is a red circular rash around the tick bite . It is often accompanied by fever , fatigue , aches and other flu-like miseries . In more advanced stages , the disease can cause arthritis and neurological problems .
