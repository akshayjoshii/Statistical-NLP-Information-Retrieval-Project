Mr Kenzaburo Oe yesterday won the Nobel prize for literature , becoming only the second Japanese writer to receive the world 's most prestigious literary award . Mr Oe 's achievement lay in 'creating an imagined world where life and myth condense to form a disturbing picture of the human predicament , ' said the Swedish Academy of Letters . Yasunari Kawabata was the previous Japanese prizewinner in 1968 . Last year the female Afro-American novelist Toni Morrison won the award .
