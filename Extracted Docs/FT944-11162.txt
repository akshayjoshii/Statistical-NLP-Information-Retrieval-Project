Britain said yesterday a senior Foreign Office official would arrive in Burma today for talks with the ruling military government . A Foreign Office spokesman said the visit , the first by a senior British official since the Burmese elections of 1990 , accorded with the European Union policy of 'critical dialogue ' with the Rangoon government . The visit by Mr David Dain , an assistant under-secretary of state , followed some 'potentially encouraging ' signals from the government , including meetings with the detained opposition leader , Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi .
