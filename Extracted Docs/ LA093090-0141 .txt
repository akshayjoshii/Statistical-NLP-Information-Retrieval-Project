If San Jose State quarterback Ralph Martini would have impressed Stanford admissions officers the way he did the school 's football coaches , the Cardinal may have been on the other end of a 29-23 loss to the Spartans . `` BYU and San Jose State recruited me , and I really wanted to come to Stanford , but my SAT scores were n't good enough , '' said Martini , whose football scores -- four touchdown passes and another two-point conversion pass -- were more than enough for a San Jose victory Saturday . `` The Spartan-Stanford game is for heroes , and today , Martini was a hero , '' said San Jose State Coach Terry Shea , whose 3-1-1 team won for the second consecutive year at Stanford , where they are 6-4 since 1981 . Martini completed 23 of 32 passes for 361 yards , without an interception , to outduel Stanford 's Jason Palumbis , who was 27 of 39 for 387 yards , with one touchdown and an interception . Stanford Coach Dennis Green , whose 1-3 team goes to South Bend , Ind. , next week to face top-ranked Notre Dame , said : `` We did n't play as well as we hoped ; we should have played better . '' Martini and Maceo Barbosa had a 72-yard touchdown pass play , San Jose State 's longest offensive play of the year , on the second play of the second half to go ahead 21-3 . But Stanford regrouped and scored 13 points in 39 seconds to trail 21-16 with 12:31 left in the third quarter . Palumbis teamed with Glyn Milburn on a 69-yard pass play down the sideline for the first Stanford touchdown , cutting the lead to 21-10 . After the Spartans fumbled away the kickoff return , Stanford 's Tommy Vardell scored on a one-yard dive to make it 21-16 . A two-point conversion try failed . Martini then took the Spartans on an eight-play , 70-yard drive late in the third quarter . He hit Bryce Burnett on a three-yard scoring pass and then found Barbosa in the end zone on the Spartans ' first two-point conversion try of the season , giving San Jose State a 29-16 lead after three quarters .
