Yesterday 's review of Venus Observed wrongly attributed the parts of Perpetua and Rosabel to Heather Stannard and Valerie Taylor . It was they who played in the original production . At Chichester the parts are played by Susannah Harker and Kate O'Mara . I apologise for the error . The compliments stand . MR .
