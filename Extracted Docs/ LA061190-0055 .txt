Israel plans to open its first liaison office in Beijing this week as a diplomatic beachhead , ending decades of estrangement with China , which traditionally has supported Israel 's enemies . The office , operated by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities at a foreign-managed hotel in downtown Beijing , will technically serve as a clearinghouse for academic exchange between the two countries and will not have official government status . Israel and China have no diplomatic relations and are unlikely to establish official ties in the foreseeable future . Beijing maintains strong political and military ties with Arab nations and has steadfastly supported the Palestinian cause . Yet the liaison office , staffed by two Israeli science academy experts , represents a watershed in a relationship that has been developing quietly in recent years . China 's immediate interest is obtaining trade and technology from Israel .
