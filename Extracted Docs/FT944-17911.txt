Moody 's , the US credit rating agency , said yesterday it might raise its rating for part of Brazil 's foreign debt , Richard Lapper reports . The action , which affects some Dollars 7.9bn of debt , comes in the wake of Mr Cardoso 's election success this week . Moody 's rating on so-called 'interest due and unpaid ' bonds and new money bonds , now B2 , could change . The agency said the review 'is motivated by the likelihood that the incoming administration will have sufficient power to implement comprehensive economic and political reforms . ' It pointed out that in recent years Brazil 's domestic economy has been relatively dynamic and commercial debt arrears had been restructured .
