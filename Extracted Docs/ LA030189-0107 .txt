Former San Antonio Spurs star George ( Iceman ) Gervin was admitted to a hospital as the victim of an apparent drug overdose , according to a San Antonio newspaper . A Methodist Hospital spokeswoman confirmed that Gervin , 38 , was taken to the hospital by ambulance Saturday , but she could not elaborate on his treatment . The San Antonio Light said that according to a police report , Gervin told an officer that he snorted what he `` thought was cocaine '' and later did not know what it was that he put up his nose . Gervin also told the officer he `` did not want to commit suicide , '' the police report stated . Spur Coach Larry Brown said he had tried to get Gervin out of retirement a month ago . `` They tell me you have got to hit rock bottom before they can make you better . Maybe this is what it 's going to take for Ice to get straight , '' Brown said .
