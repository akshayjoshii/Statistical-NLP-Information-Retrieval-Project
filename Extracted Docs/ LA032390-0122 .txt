Don McLean first came into prominence for his songwriting . Critics hailed his 1972 mega-hit , `` American Pie , '' as the musical epitaph for an era ; its lyrics were analyzed and reanalyzed by Life , Time and Newsweek . Nearly two decades later , McLean , now 44 , has come out with a double album consisting entirely of interpretations of old pop songs . `` For the Memories , Volumes 1 and 2 '' is a collection of 20 classics from the 1930s through the early '60s , including Hoagie Carmichael 's `` Stardust , '' Irving Berlin 's `` Change Partners , '' Marty Robbins ' `` A White Sport Coat '' and Sam Cooke 's `` What a Wonderful World . '' `` I 'm not just a songwriter , and I 've always felt there were certain songs I could sing as a singer but never write , '' said McLean , who will perform Saturday night at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa . `` They were songs I 've always loved , and I felt I could do them in a different way , in my way , and interpret them as a pop singer would interpret popular songs . `` It 's just something I felt like doing , and I did it very quickly . I just went into the studio and sang and sang and sang , and it took about two days to record and mix the whole thing . '' McLean 's attempts to focus attention on his pipes rather than his pen date back to 1981 , when he scored a big hit with a remake of Roy Orbison 's `` Crying . '' Since then , he 's made a point of mixing covers with originals , both in concert and on his albums , to further defy the topical-songwriter categorization that 's haunted him since `` American Pie . '' McLean has never felt comfortable with that label , and with good reason : Variety has always been the essence of his career . One of the first songs he ever wrote , `` And I Love You So , '' was a huge easy-listening hit for veteran pop crooner Perry Como . Less than two years after `` American Pie , '' McLean recorded an album of songs in traditional folk and bluegrass styles . On subsequent recordings , he 's been backed by everything from rock bands to symphony orchestras , and in 1987 he cut a straight-ahead country album , `` Love Tracks . '' `` I 'm a lot of different Don McLeans , '' he said . `` I want to do something different with every record I do , so that when I 'm dead and buried , you can go back and listen to all my records and not find any songs that sound alike . `` I want to use my career , and my chance to record , to express a wide variety of my talents , and this has always been my plan , my hope . It 's not a great idea if you want to be super commercial , but from the first album I ever made ( 1970 's 'Tapestry ' ) , I decided this is what I want to do . `` If you go back to 'Tapestry , ' there 's stuff with a quartet , stuff with strings and stuff with just me and my guitar . And at the time , nobody else was doing that -- the record companies would say , pick a sound and stick with it for 10 sides . But I could never do that , and I never did . '' McLean was born in New Rochelle , N. Y. , and grew up listening to such disparate artists as Frank Sinatra , the Weavers and Buddy Holly . `` My father died when I was 15 , and I was left with a widowed mother who I had to support , '' McLean recalled . `` But I was also free to pursue my dream , which was to play my guitar and sing , and that 's what I did . `` When I was 17 , I went on the road and began performing in coffeehouses all over the country , but at the same time I was going to school . My father had always wanted me to go to college , and I did , studying economics at Iona College ( in New Rochelle ) . I was on the road , and I usually had a school book with me . '' After graduating in 1968 with a bachelor 's degree in economics , McLean struck up a friendship with folk singer Pete Seeger . The two sang together at a benefit concert for the Hudson River Sloop Restoration , and later that year McLean was named `` Hudson River Troubadour '' by the New York State Council on the Arts . For six weeks , he traveled the length of the river , playing three concerts a day , five days a week , in various towns along the Hudson . In 1969 , McLean landed a recording contract with Mediarts Records , which was promptly absorbed by the nationally distributed United Artists label . `` Tapestry '' came out a year later , followed by `` American Pie . '' The title track , an 8 1/2-minute saga inspired by the death of Buddy Holly , went on to become one of the biggest-selling singles of 1972 . `` I had always been a great lover of Buddy Holly 's music , and I felt his death personally , '' McLean said . `` I kept that with me , and one day it just came out . I fused my feelings about his death with a whole bag of other things in my heart about this sense of loss , this sense that we were somehow losing America , and it just turned into that song . '' The overwhelming critical and commercial success of `` American Pie '' -- which ultimately spent four weeks at No . 1 on the national Top 40 charts -- made McLean an instant superstar . But he soon discovered that fame is fleeting . After scoring three follow-up hits with `` Vincent '' ( a tribute to artist Vincent van Gogh ) , `` Castles in the Air '' and `` Dreidel '' -- and being immortalized by songwriters Charles Gimble and Norman Fox in `` Killing Me Softly With His Song , '' Roberta Flack 's Grammy Award-winning single of 1973 -- McLean pretty much faded from view , although he continued to record and tour . `` I really was n't in a great mental state during those years , '' he said . `` The stresses and the strains of many things developed into a situation that was n't happy . The relationship between the people representing me and my label soured , and , coupled with the fact that I had a lot of personal problems , I was n't altogether thrilled with the way things turned out . '' In 1976 , McLean left United Artists and signed with Arista Records . His Arista debut , 1977 's `` Prime Time , '' was a commercial dud ; four years later , he resurfaced on the Millennium label with `` Chain Lightning , '' which yielded the Top 40 hit `` Crying . '' Since then , McLean has jumped ship two more times -- first to Capitol Records , after a protracted legal battle with his former manager , then to the Gold Castle label -- but he has yet to find his way back to the pop charts . He says that does n't bother him . `` I have a full concert schedule every year , and I 've made enough money to keep me set for life , '' McLean said . `` Besides , if your whole life is centered around image and show business , you 're bound to be a tortured individual . `` Once you 've been No . 1 , once you 've won your Grammys and your gold records , there 's only one place to go , and that 's down . So you really have to have another life , which is why I have so many other things I 'm interested in aside from concentrating on being Don McLean , on recapturing my past success . '' McLean is putting together a musical , `` Don McLean 's America , '' scheduled to open in June at the Chichester Festival Theater in England .
