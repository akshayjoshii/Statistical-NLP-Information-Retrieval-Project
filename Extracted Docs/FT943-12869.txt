Sir , We here disturbed to read the report by Emma Tucker and John Ridding on Air France 's bid for further state aid ( 'Brussels set to back state aid for ailing Air France ' , July 21 ) . The further propping up of this carrier will do as much harm to air transport users as it will to competitor airlines . Under pressure from the French government , Air France is flying routes that are not economically viable given its cost structure . This not only undermines the profitability of current competitors but also deters the emergence of new low-cost airlines . It is vital that the Commission requires Air France to make big cuts in capacity . In markets which are not overshadowed by a state-supported carrier we are now witnessing a significant number of new services , often provided by new regional airlines . These carriers must be able to establish themselves now , as air travel growth resumes , if they are to stand any chance of longer-term survival . The provision of more state aid can only hinder them and will for the foreseeable future deny users the full benefits of liberalisation .
