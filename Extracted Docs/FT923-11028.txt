Howard Davies , the CBI 's high profile new director general , has an intriguing explanation for the bizarre affair of Alison Halford and her inability to win promotion in the Merseyside police force . Davies , a former boss of the Audit Commission , blames a manpower control system operated by the Home Office under which police forces can bid each year for the right to employ additional officers . Every year some new constables are allocated . 'There is no provision in the system for police numbers to fall , ever ' , says Davies , in a column in last Friday 's Evening Standard . As a result of this system there are now almost twice as many policemen per thousand inhabitants in declining Merseyside as in Cambridgeshire , where the population is growing . Merseyside is the most intensely policed area in the country . 'No wonder they have to find exotic ways of passing the time ' , says Davies . Indeed , he calculates that if present trends continue there will be only policemen left in Merseyside 60 years from now and if they do not recruit any women the force will die out .
