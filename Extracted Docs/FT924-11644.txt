EMPEROR Akihito of Japan last night said he 'deeply deplored ' the suffering caused during the Japanese army 's occupation of China , but fell short of issuing a formal apology . At a state banquet in his honour in Beijing , however , Emperor Akihito went further in atoning for Japan 's actions than his father Hirohito - the god-monarch who presided over Japan during the second world war and who usually expressed his 'regret ' about the past on such occasions . 'In the long history of the relationship between our two countries , there was an unfortunate period in which my country inflicted great sufferings on the people of China , ' Emperor Akihito said . ' I deeply deplore this . When the war came to an end the Japanese people , believing with a sense of deep reproach that such a war should never be repeated , resolved to tread the road of a peaceful nation . ' Although the speech may satisfy the Chinese government - which is keen to encourage Japanese investment in China - it is moot whether it will satisfy public opinion . The Chinese have been schooled , as a matter of government policy , in Japan's war atrocities in their country . As many as 10m Chinese citizens are estimated to have been killed during the occupation , which began with the Manchurian incident in 1931 and ended with Japan 's defeat in the Pacific war in 1945 . Museums have been erected in many parts of the country to glorify the Communist party 's resistance to the Japanese invasion and to emphasise the brutality of its occupation . The Chinese government had allowed some citizens to agitate against Japan in the run-up to Emperor Akihito 's visit and has permitted publication of calls for Japan to pay Dollars 180bn ( Pounds 110.4bn ) in war reparations , despite waiving the right to seek them when normalising relations 20 years ago .
