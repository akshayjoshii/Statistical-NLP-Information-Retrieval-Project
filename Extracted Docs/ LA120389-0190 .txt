As a resident of neighboring Orange , I thoroughly enjoyed your Sunday editorial `` Tustin Springs Backward '' ( Nov. 26 ) , about the Tustin City Council 's unprecedented decision to shift its city elections from November to April , thereby allowing potential challengers only four months to organize their campaigns . It should also be noted that Mayor Richard B. Edgar had previously stated that a special April election would attract `` better-informed '' voters . By that he presumably means `` better informed '' by himself or Mayor Pro Tem Ursula E. Kennedy , but not by his opponents , who would be hard-pressed for time to effectively present their own views and who lack the financial resources of developers ' contributions that Mayor Edgar so richly enjoys himself . I sincerely hope that Tustin residents will succeed in challenging the election-date switch and return a sense of fairness to its elected government . WALTER ADAMS Orange
