Hopes that Taiwanese companies could raise fresh equity through the launch of convertible eurobonds look set to be dashed as the first of a rush of issues since 1989 comes up for repayment later this month . The authorities in Taipei have yet to reach agreement on rules allowing foreigners to convert their holdings into listed shares , although the matter has been the subject of debate since Yuen Foong Yu Paper ( YFY ) , a listed paper manufacturer , issued Taiwan 's first convertible bond in 1989 . YFY may thus have to redeem its Dollars 120m issue in cash when a put option falls due on December 21 . To date , 29 Taiwanese companies have issued euroconvertible bonds , mostly in the past year . But because foreign individuals are not permitted to buy Taiwan shares directly , government departments have been unable to solve the dilemma presented by conversion . The central bank and the finance ministry , to which the Securities and Exchange Commission reports , have agreed in principle that convertible bonds may be switched into global depository receipts . However , the details of such a conversion method have yet to be worked out . Investor appetite for Taiwanese paper has largely evaporated due to oversupply following a flurry of issues this year . Secondary trading has dried up and proposed new issues are being met coolly amid rising interest rates and concern over the lack of convertibility . In YFY 's case , the point is moot as the current share price makes conversion unattractive . But several other issues have met criteria for conversion set out in issue documents . A number of Taiwanese companies have delayed or cancelled planned convertible issues as the cost has risen almost to the level of raising funds domestically . In October Formosa Plastics Corp , the petrochemical company , shelved plans to raise USDollars 300m in convertible bonds .
