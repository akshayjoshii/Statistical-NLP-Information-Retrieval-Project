SCIENCE today feeds the Hollywood hype machine the last morsel it needs to promote Steven Spielberg 's latest film . On the eve of Jurassic Park opening in the US , a research team has announced that it has extracted the first samples of genetic material from the dinosaur era . The researchers include Dr George Pionar of the University of California , Berkeley , who was a scientific adviser to the heavily promoted Jurassic Park . Its plot is based on the use of genetic engineering to re-create dinosaurs , starting from the DNA in blood sucked by mosquitoes that were then preserved in amber for more than 100m years . The Pionar group has isolated insect DNA from a weevil trapped 120m years ago in Lebanese amber . It is 80m years older than any DNA extracted previously from amber - fossilised tree resin that has a unique capacity to preserve organic material - and is the first from an animal alive when dinosaurs roamed the earth . Such a discovery would have seemed like science fiction be-fore researchers started studying ancient genes in the mid-1980s . It depends on gene-amplifying technology called polymerase chain reaction , which enables scientists to make billions of copies of any piece of DNA . The Californian scientists obtained enough DNA to carry out a genetic comparison with present-day weevils . But it represents less than one-millionth of the ancient creature 's total genetic complement - all of which would be needed to resurrect the extinct species . Nature , the UK journal which publishes the Californian DNA research in today 's issue , insists that its release a day before the film is 'pure coincidence ' . Merchandising monster , Page 9
