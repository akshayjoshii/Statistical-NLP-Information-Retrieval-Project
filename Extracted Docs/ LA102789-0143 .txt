A new Costa Mesa police policy allows people caught with outstanding misdemeanor warrants to get a warning rather than a trip to jail , a top police official said Thursday . Under a policy adopted by the department , only people who received a warrant for skipping an appearance in Harbor Municipal Court will get hauled off to see the judge , Police Capt . Tom Lazar said . All others are simply warned to clear up their warrants and set free , unless officers from the department that originally arrested them want to come and get them . Without the change of policy -- it was quietly instituted about two months ago -- Costa Mesa officers would have to drive prisoners wanted for violations in other jurisdictions directly to County Jail , sharply reducing patrol time , Lazar said . For years , Costa Mesa officers avoided the drive and wait at the central jail by simply dropping off warrant violators at Harbor Court . There , all of those whose warrants were issued in other Municipal Courts would be held in a marshal 's lockup to await a sheriff 's bus for a ride to jail . But during the summer , the Sheriff 's Department stopped providing the bus service for warrant violators . Sheriff 's Lt. Richard J. Olson said the service was stopped because the prisoners would have to wait hours before receiving medical checks upon their arrival at the main jail . Without the checks , the Sheriff 's Department could be exposed to legal liability if a prisoner were later found to be seriously ill or injured . Harbor Court handles cases originating in Costa Mesa , Newport Beach and Irvine . CHRIS WOODYARD
