He swallowed his words saying , `` We have done some things wrong in this Administration and the top man always takes the responsibility . . . . '' He fought back tears talking about his father , who owned the `` poorest lemon ranch in California , '' then sold it before they struck oil and became a grocer . `` But he was a great man because he did his job . . . . '' And when he mentioned his mother , whom he said no one would ever write a book about , his voice fell to a whisper . `` Well , I guess all of you would say this about your mother '' -- he paused -- `` my mother was a saint . '' Remember ? It was from Richard Nixon 's last speech as President on Friday Aug. , 9 , 1974 , coming back to TV in the form of docudrama . And these were the final days in the shooting of `` The Final Days '' -- a three-hour movie for ABC based on the 1976 book by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein -- with actor Lane Smith as Nixon . As the fourth in a series of AT & T Presents dramas , `` Final Days '' airs next season . In the Gold Room at Pasadena Civic Auditorium late last winter -- the high-ceilinged ballroom bore the closest resemblance the producers could find to the East Room of the White House -- there was a palpable hush among the cast and 200 extras as Smith portrayed Nixon . Behind the Nixon character a pace and off to his left stood actress Susan Brown , looking oh-so-much like the real Pat Nixon with her prim hairdo and pink-and-white gingham dress just like the one the First Lady wore that final day . As Mrs. Nixon , the actress also wore a stoic face reddened by the effort to stay in control . The characters of the two Nixon daughters and sons-in-law completed the picture . Now 15 years later -- and much to the disapproval of Nixon family loyalists -- here they all are again -- Dick and Pat , Watergate and the lawyers , the courts and the tapes . Facing certain impeachment on charges of obstruction of justice and abuse of power , the 37th President had virtually no choice but to resign . The irony was that it was not the actual break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in 1972 that forced the first presidential resignation in American history , but the cover-up afterward . As the last chapter of the Watergate scandal , written by the two Washington Post reporters who broke the Watergate story , `` Final Days '' was the stuff of high drama . Like the book , the script deals with the behind-the-scenes saga of the last 15 months in the Nixon White House . The mood of fatalism is summed up early on in the docudrama when Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment , played by `` St . Elsewhere 's '' Ed Flanders , says : `` We 've got time bombs all over . Some have already exploded , the rest lie ticking . . . . '' `` I did n't want to do the obvious , '' said executive producer Stu Samuels , who had been ABC 's vice president for movies and miniseries when `` The Day After , '' the landmark drama about nuclear war , and `` Something About Amelia , '' the first TV movie to deal with incest , were made . `` I did n't want to bash Nixon . '' Without prompting , Samuels shrugged . `` Because it 's too easy . The issue for me was : How do you provide insight into the mistake ? Clearly Nixon had made a mistake . How did that happen ? '' `` Look at the man 's accomplishments : Nixon remains one of the most outstanding Presidents in contemporary history with regard to his achievements . He did get us out of Vietnam . He did reopen a dialogue with China . This is not a stupid man , a man given to casual error . . . . `` There 's a wonderful moment in the movie , '' Samuels said , `` when Nixon is in his E.O.B . ( Executive Office Building ) office , when he says to ( Press Secretary Ron ) Ziegler , 'Maybe we were talking about a cover-up . ' It 's as though he were waking from a dream , at least from an unconscious state , and asking himself , 'Is this what we were doing ? ' Our own assessment is that this President acted as though he were on a kind of auto pilot . '' The script was written by Hugh Whitemore , an Englishman who wrote `` Concealed Enemies , '' PBS ' Emmy-winning `` American Playhouse '' miniseries about the Alger Hiss case ( in which then-Rep. Nixon had a featured role ) , as well as the plays `` Pack of Lies '' and `` Breaking the Code . '' Both Samuels and ABC felt that a non-American would be more dispassionate . Whitemore anchored his script around Nixon lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt . `` It 's pure instinct , but dramatically it seems to me things work better with much less-known people , '' the writer said . So , while the relatively unfamiliar Smith and Brown respectively play Nixon and Mrs. Nixon , Richard Kiley ( `` A Year in the Life , '' `` Man of La Mancha '' ) is Buzhardt . Asked what attracted him to the role of Buzhardt , one the least known of the Watergate players , Kiley snapped to attention : `` You just answered your own question . He was one of the mystery men , very much behind the scenes , and yet he played a key role . He was the one who really found the incriminating ( tape ) passages . . . . '' Woodward , now an assistant managing editor at the Washington Post and author of another controversial book-turned-movie , `` Wired , '' about the final days of comedian John Belushi , was an active consultant on the production . He supplied notes on Buzhardt . It was in the final speech that Nixon shed some emotional masks , as well as a certain vanity . Reading a passage from Theodore Roosevelt 's diary , he put his glasses on for the first time in public . So does Smith in his long monologue . How do you play Nixon ? And how do you bypass what director Richard Pearce calls the bump -- that instant when the audience knows it 's an actor , after all ? Pearce ( `` Country , '' `` Heartland '' ) , who was in Yale 's Class of 1965 with Woodward though they did n't know each other then , said he `` did not want the portrait of Nixon to be charged with a star turn , somebody who is doing Nixon . '' So , with ABC 's consent , he chose Smith , 50 , originally from Memphis , a professional actor for 29 years , who won a Drama Desk award for his role in `` Glengarry Glen Ross '' on Broadway . The actor was cast so hurriedly as Nixon -- less than a week before shooting began -- that he had no time to read the book . His hairline was shaved to resemble Nixon 's , and each morning his hair had to be finger-waved . But a prosthetic ski-jump nose was not used . Neither Pearce nor Smith wanted `` imitation '' or `` caricature . '' Preparing to read for ABC , Smith found an old Nixon tape . `` I got the physicality of Nixon , '' Smith said . `` He 's so specific in what he does , but you have to get it to the point where it 's second nature to you , and then not overdo it . '' `` I stay pretty much in character the whole time I 'm here , I stay in the physicality . I 'll show you , '' Smith said , standing and hitching up his trousers . `` My father used to wear his pants real high like they did in those days . And all of a sudden I saw pictures of Nixon with his pants way up to here . So you put your pants up there , and it 's a little tilt back , and then all of a sudden it 's just there . . . . '' Smith captured the Nixon wave as he stood on the helicopter ramp , when he realized Nixon `` throws his hand away almost . His wrist , it 's limp but it 's not effeminate . And I think part of that physicality is that there 's so much emotion there . '' The actor deliberately did not view tapes of Nixon 's final speech , but he said he could play it because he understands loss . `` Here you have this man totally isolated from everybody , from his loved ones . He ca n't reach out to a soul . With all the power and majesty of his office , you have him isolated down to three or four people . So you see the pain . '' Was n't the pain brought on by Nixon himself , Smith was asked ? `` Pain is pain . I ca n't approach this , right or wrong , who 's going to throw the first stone here ? Regardless of whether he brought this upon himself , it 's tragedy , Greek tragedy , it 's Richard III , the fatal flaw . And I had to evoke in my experience that pain . . . . I called on the very most private things that have occurred to me , as far as the loss of a great love , and the isolation , when things totally turned against me in my life . '' He was quiet for a moment , making it clear he would not brook further questions , then added : `` If there is a parallel between Nixon and Lane Smith , it 's that I 've been waiting for this moment for many , many years and for this kind of work . So when it came about , even with this short a period of time , it 's like everything that I know , my whole experience of 36 years , 29 professional , it all came together . '' For Pearce , 15 years after Nixon 's resignation , his movie must balance `` the emotional issues surrounding this man 's loss of the presidency and the abuses of power that went on during the Nixon presidency . It 's not the sorrow and the pity , it 's like the horror and the pity . . . . '' Two days after principal photography was done in March , the director was discussing technique as well as politics . `` We begin the movie -- it 's not in the script -- when Nixon is backstage on nomination night '68 , and it echoes everything up to the ( Robert F. ) Kennedy assassination . All the Secret Service are there , and the kitchen help and the campaigners , and you ( Nixon ) are like a rock star . `` For me there 's a great shot from an early film when people were first working with hand-held cameras . It 's a documentary called 'Primary ' about ( John F. ) Kennedy in the Wisconsin primary . This was ( early ) cinema verite where people were following a character around . The camera was right behind the back of his head , and you saw what it was like to be Kennedy that night . '' Pearce would have liked to take the Nixon character onto the stage `` to see the whole place rise up '' but he said budgetary constraints precluded re-creating the GOP Convention in Miami . `` But we could take him right up to the moment that he walks out on stage , '' Pearce continued , `` and then with stock footage , you see Nixon from a distance , the footage so far away you can accept it . Then we go to the speech that begins the script , and the preparations for it . You do n't see Lane Smith 's face . You see it the way you saw Kennedy -- you never saw Jack Kennedy 's face ; you saw everybody else relating to him . You never hear Nixon 's actual voice . You hear Lane 's voice . `` Then what happens , you gradually introduce the image of him as Nixon on a TV monitor . It was easier to introduce him where you sort of felt he was President . He 's talking about accepting the resignations of ( H.R . ) Haldeman and ( John ) Ehrlichman , he 's speaking about Watergate . . . . '' By the end of that speech , said Pearce , `` we will have seen enough of Lane as President to allow him to speak directly to the audience . '' -- -- The Nixon camp apparently first learned about a TV production of `` The Final Days '' after Pearce phoned Steve Bull , now a tobacco company lobbyist who had been Nixon 's personal aide . `` You can imagine , I 'm going to have to re-create not just the words but what it felt like to be in the room . Did Nixon pace ? Did he just sit at his desk ? Did somebody smoke ? Hundreds of questions . . . . '' So Pearce invited Bull to the set . `` Suddenly he was talking as if this was an ideological issue . The book was the enemy , Woodward and Bernstein were the enemy . '' Samuels says with pride that the script scrupulously adheres to the book , `` the primary source . '' `` We are dealing with a living ex-President , and in all of us there was a sense of responsibility for getting it right . You do n't want to take cheap shots . It was n't a question of libel . On the other hand , here is a book written by two of America 's most noted journalists , in existence for years now , and with no legal action against it . '' Old arguments involving the accuracy of specific incidents in `` The Final Days '' ( see story on Page 80 ) also did not bother Alfred R. Schneider , ABC vice president for policy and standards . `` We relied on the veracity of the book , '' he said , adding : `` It 's certainly of notice that ( a lawsuit ) did not occur . '' Still the script does contain certain inaccuracies , such as having Nixon in the White House as the Supreme Court unanimously ruled he had to turn over crucial tapes , when actually he was in San Clemente . `` I kept driving ( Whitemore ) back to what 's in the book , '' noted Woodward , `` and for reasons of compression he may have had to do it a different way . In 'All the President 's Men , ' they had to compress the city editor and metropolitan editor into one character . . . . As a reporter , I would do it the way it happened . '' But he quickly added that he and Bernstein had the `` luxury of a 450-page book . '' More important , Woodward noted , Whitemore caught `` the emotional reality '' inside the White House , the `` isolation '' of Nixon . `` As I watched some of it being made , there 's not a wasted word or phrase . It 's very tight , very directed at the target -- 'What was it like ? ' Jack Kennedy 's question to journalists always ( had been ) 'Tell me what it was like . ' `` At Samuels ' request , Woodward phoned Schneider to clear up two problems the ABC executive had with the script . One was the Kissinger-Nixon prayer scene , '' Woodward said , `` and essentially there are differences in the ( Kissinger and 'Final Days ' ) versions , and I said , 'Now sit down and read 'em both . What 's really different here , and what 's disputed ? . . . There 's really minor difference . ' `` In `` Final Days , '' Woodward and Bernstein wrote that Kissinger knelt along with Nixon that Wednesday night before Nixon resigned . Nixon seemed to back them up , Woodward points out . In his memoirs Nixon said he asked Kissinger `` to pray with me now and we knelt . '' Kissinger wrote : `` In whatever posture , I was filled with a deep sense of awe . '' Woodward also stands by their book 's account of Nixon pounding the carpet . Even Kissinger described Nixon as `` shattered , '' Woodward said . On a second point , Woodward said he and Schneider discussed a scene in the script , which is in the book , where Nixon is portrayed gnawing at an aspirin bottle because he ca n't open it with his hands . `` They had to make sure it was an illustration of clumsiness , and not that he was going to ( kill himself ) , '' Woodward said , `` and that it was aspirin . . . . '' Woodward said he told Schneider he could justify everything he and Bernstein wrote -- in court , `` if it ever came to that , but we would n't reveal our sources . '' But it 's `` not the issue now , '' Woodward explained . `` The essential historical point is that with time , truth emerges . '' `` I 'll tell you one thing that Hugh Whitemore used , '' Woodward said . `` When Julie ( Nixon Eisenhower ) said in her book the family was talking about the tape transcripts and Nixon says , 'Was it worth it ? ' ... Wow , I wished we 'd had that line . '' -- -- From Woodcliff Lake , N.J. where Nixon has his office , not far from his home in Saddle River , aide John Taylor said the ex-President has `` lived through hammer blow after hammer blow of pressure and controversy . Frankly an ABC Entertainment dramatization of 'The Final Days , ' at this late point , is really not going to keep Richard Nixon up nights . '' Associated Press
