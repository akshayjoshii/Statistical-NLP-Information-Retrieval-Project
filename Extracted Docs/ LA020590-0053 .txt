Although the genetic defect that causes sickle cell disease has been known for more than 30 years , researchers have not been able to develop an effective therapy for the disease , which strikes one in 400 blacks born in the United States . When the oxygen content of blood from individuals with the disease falls below normal levels , as from exercise , red blood cells become deformed and impair circulation , causing damage to organs . One problem in developing potential therapies is that researchers had never been able to produce the disease in animals to provide a testing ground . Molecular biologists from the Universities of Alabama , Pennsylvania and Washington reported last week in Science , however , that they used genetic engineering to produce mice with sickle cell disease . The researchers inserted the defective human gene for hemoglobin ( the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells ) into mice , where the gene produced human hemoglobin . These animals were then cross-bred with mice who normally produce inadequate quantities of mouse hemoglobin . More than 90 % of the red blood cells in the resultant mice contained the defective hemoglobin , and these cells sickle when their oxygen content is reduced . The researchers are studying the long-term effects of such sickling in the animals .
