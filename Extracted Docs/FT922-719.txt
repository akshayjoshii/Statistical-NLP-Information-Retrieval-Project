It may soon be possible to modify a person 's sense of taste , or even to restore it when it is lost or damaged as the result of illness . The Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in Nutley , New Jersey , funded by the Basel-based Hoffman-La Roche pharmaceuticals group , has made a breakthrough in understanding how the sense of taste works . The research team has discovered and cloned a protein which is only found in taste cells . The new protein is a taste-specific ( gustatory ) member of a gene family known as G-proteins which play a crucial signalling role in several types of cells including those in the brain , eyes and heart . Potential applications include the development of novel taste modifying agents and medical uses . Loss of the sense of taste is common after some illnesses and sometimes occurs as a side effect of drug or radiation therapy . Hoffman-La Roche : Switzerland , 61 688 8888 .
