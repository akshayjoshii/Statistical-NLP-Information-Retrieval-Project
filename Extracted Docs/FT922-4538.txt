If one comment about Canary Wharf particularly wounded Olympia & York , it was likening the Docklands to Croydon . The irony is that the comparison is , if anything , unfair to Croydon . Croydon is the sixth largest office centre in the UK . Although it has the same amount of office space as the Docklands - 10m sq ft - the vacancy rate in Croydon is just 8 per cent , compared with about 50 per cent in the Docklands . The Dockland 's transport system is still embryonic , while Croydon has 20 railway stations and two motorways on its doorstep . In stark contrast with the Docklands , the growth of Croydon in the 1960s was a triumph for its developers and Croydon Corporation , which fostered it . But not everything is going Croydon 's way . Office rents have fallen by up to 30 per cent in the past 18 months ; and office vacancies are likely to increase as leases expire and company relocations slow down . Perhaps the most damaging aspect of Croydon is the appearance of its serried ranks of tired 1960s office blocks . But if Croydon 's 1960s architecture is now heartily despised , what chance do the bland facades of the Docklands have of standing the test of time ?
