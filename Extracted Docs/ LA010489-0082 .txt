Tall and pale and young and handsome , the guy from Yugoslavia came walking . He was my driver , taking me from my sterile , corporate Los Angeles hotel to LAX . `` So what do you do when you 're not driving a car ? '' I asked him , knowing that anyone who is young and handsome in Los Angeles has Big Plans . `` You mean , am I actor ? '' he said in a thick Slavic accent . `` No , I am not actor . I am screenwriter . '' `` What kind of stuff do you write ? '' I asked , amused . I had heard that an L.A. newspaper once put a guy out on Melrose Avenue to ask passers-by , `` How 's your screenplay going ? '' Nine out of 10 responded , `` Almost finished . '' `` I write crap . . . , '' he said , the way Bela Lugosi says , `` I am Count Dracula . '' I giggled , but he continued in a passionately serious tone . `` I write thrillers . I write the crap that these people want to see , '' he said , gesturing to the mall-sprawl world we motored through . `` What these people want is junk . That 's what they line up for . I write that . `` I do it only for money . That 's all I care about is money . When I sell screenplay , I get $ 200,000 . If I wanted to be Dostoevksy , I 'd write book . I want money . That 's why I 'm here . That 's why I write . '' He explained that he left Yugoslavia , where he , like his parents , was an intellectual and a writer , to come to the United States . He said no country in the world has as much democracy and freedom as this country . `` And what will you do with all the money ? '' I asked . `` Ah , that is question , that is very good question , '' he said . `` I do n't know . '' `` So , do you have an agent ? '' I asked , trying to decide if he was serious . `` No . No agent , '' he said , `` but . . . I know a guy who knows Stallone . '' What we had here was a 28-year-old man with a degree in philosophy from the University of Belgrade who had been in the United States for 18 months -- and already knew a guy who knew a guy . `` This must be very hard for you , writing in a different culture , '' I offered . `` Are your stories set in Europe ? '' `` No , I only write about America . It is not hard . I know what to expect when I come here . Nothing surprised me . I drove big American car like this in Yugoslavia . I wrote screenplays there . But they pay nothing -- $ 5,000 . Here , you write trash and they give you a lot of money . That 's why I come . '' `` But what about the language problem ? Do n't you find it hard to write in English ? '' `` Not a problem , '' he said . `` I write in Yugoslavian . '' ( I was trying to imagine the pitch meeting : `` Yo , Stallone , I got piece of trash written in Yugoslavian . Perfect for you . '' ) `` So you have a story for Stallone . What 's it about ? '' `` It 's about a bodyguard who catches his boss in bed with the President 's wife . Then he blackmails him . '' The handsome screenwriter does , in fact , have a translator . This driver is no idiot , even if he is trying to write junk that stupid Americans would line up to see . He was inspired , he explained , by one of Hegel 's greatest hits . `` Have you read Hegel 's 'Phenomenology of Spirit ' ? '' he asked . `` No , '' I said . `` But I did see 'Ernest Saves Christmas . ' `` We then talked about the master-servant relationship -- as Hegel saw it , as Stallone might develop it . `` But with your attitude , '' I asked , `` do n't you think you 'll have a problem at a pitch meeting ? Is n't 95 % of what goes on in L.A. just sales ? You must agree that the best salesmen are those who believe in their product . '' `` Yes , could be problem , '' he admitted , `` but I will not tell them it is crap . '' This all cheered me up . I was well ahead of the game . See , my screenplay 's in English , and it ai n't half bad .
