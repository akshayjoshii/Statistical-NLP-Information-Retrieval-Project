A COMPUTER software battle has erupted between Sun Microsystems , the leading manufacturer of computer workstations , and Microsoft , the world 's largest computer software company . Sun has challenged Microsoft 's dominant position in the software market by announcing the joint development with Unix Systems Laboratories of technology allowing Unix computers to run word processing , spreadsheet and database applications designed for use on personal computers running Microsoft 's Windows operating system . Sun said its new technology , known as Wabi and based on work by Praxsys Technologies , would enable Unix system users to run Microsoft Windows applications 'right out of the box ' . Until now this could be done only by using a software 'emulator ' that acted like a personal computer , degrading the performance of a Unix computer . Sun claimed that , through Wabi , the performance of Unix computers running Windows applications would be about 50 per cent higher than other computers using the Microsoft 's Windows operating system . Sun 's move is a pre-emptive attack on Microsoft 's imminent high-performance version of Windows , known as Windows NT . Mr Scott McNealy , Sun Microsystems chief executive , said : 'We are taking ( Microsoft 's ) Windows volume standard and making it 'open ' . ' Computer users would be able to exploit Windows applications without being dependent on Microsoft , he added . But Microsoft has announced it would also offer programmes enabling Windows applications to run on Unix computers and Apple 's Macintosh machines . Microsoft questioned Sun 's performance claims for Wabi . Mr Bill Gates , chairman and chief executive , also said Microsoft would check Wabi for any infringement of intellectual property rights . But Sun argued Wabi technology , available to software developers in about 90 days , contained no Microsoft technology .
