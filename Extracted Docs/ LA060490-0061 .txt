A toppled electrical pole caused officials to close California 118 -- one of Ventura County 's main east-west roads -- for 12 hours Sunday , forcing motorists to detour nearly nine miles . A van ran off the road and knocked down the pole at 5:49 a.m. , blocking the road about a mile west of Moorpark , said Officer David Wighton of the California Highway Patrol . Motorists were detoured onto Grimes Canyon Road , Broadway , Stockton Road and Balcom Canyon Road until 5:49 p.m. , when California 118 reopened . `` We 've had traffic going by here all day long , '' said Fauvette Rollyson , who lives on Stockton . `` Fortunately , this was not a weekday or the trucks would be unbelievable . '' Wighton agreed . `` On a weekday you get a heavy commuter traffic , but today was pretty light , '' he said . Another Stockton Road resident , Richard Allen , said he counted almost 100 cars a minute going in both directions during peak traffic on the detour . `` It was steady , almost bumper-to-bumper , '' Allen said , adding that Stockton Road normally is seldom used . `` Usually , on a weekend , if someone goes by I go out to see who it is , '' Allen said . Keith Sheldon , a spokesman for Southern California Edison Co. , said the toppled wires were `` live '' and had to be handled carefully . Then a new pole had to be installed and wires restrung before the road could be reopened . The accident cut power to residents in the immediate area , Sheldon said . Rollyson said her home lost power for about 75 minutes , but Allen had no power loss . The accident occurred when Salvador Padilla , 28 , of Pomona , driving a Chevrolet van west on 118 , veered across the opposing lane , left the roadway and hit the pole , Wighton said . Padilla left the scene but was found in Moorpark about 5 1/2 hours later by deputies of the Ventura County Sheriff 's Department , Lt. Kelly McIlvain said . He has not been cited , Wighton said .
