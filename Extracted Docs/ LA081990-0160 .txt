Punch Line : If Matt Williams -- who batted .200 , hit only one home run and struck out 11 times when the San Francisco Giants went 2-8 on a trip that ended Wednesday -- follows teammates Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell in winning the National League 's runs batted in title , it will mark only the second time that a team has produced three consecutive titlists . The New York Yankees did it with Bob Meusel , Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig in 1925 , '26 and '27 . Add Williams : His main hurdle may not be Joe Carter of the San Diego Padres , but the injury wave that has forced the Giants to use the disabled list 14 times , equaling last year 's club record . The Giants have used 45 players , including a club-record 23 pitchers , four fewer than the major league single-season record shared by the 1915 Philadelphia Athletics , the 1955 Kansas City A 's and the 1967 New York Mets . Whitewash : The New York Yankees have never won fewer than two games of a season series from any opponent in their history . They were 2-11 against the Baltimore Orioles in 1982 , 2-10 against the Minnesota Twins in 1969 and 2-19 against the Boston Red Sox in 1912 . But with three games remaining against the Oakland Athletics , they are 0-9 , having been outscored , 43-6 . Intimidated ? `` We sure have n't done anything to dispute that , '' Manager Stump Merrill said . Homerdome : The Metrodome is still that for opponents , but not the Minnesota Twins , who have been out-homered there , 58-35 . Kent Hrbek has hit only five of his 18 home runs at home , and Gary Gaetti has hit only five of 13 there . Adding to the power outage , Kirby Puckett has only five extra-base hits in 115 at-bats since his last home run on July 15 . Witt 's Roll : Bobby Witt of the Texas Rangers is 9-0 with a 1.77 earned-run average in his last 11 starts . He set a club single-season record with his ninth consecutive victory Wednesday night , a 2-1 win over the Kansas City Royals . Of Witt , Royal Manager John Wathan said : `` Everybody always knew about the arm he had . Now it looks like he finally has it together . We have n't seen better stuff from anybody -- I mean , anybody . '' ROSS NEWHAN
