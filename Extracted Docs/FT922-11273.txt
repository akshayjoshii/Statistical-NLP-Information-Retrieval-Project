Sir , You correctly state in your editorial : 'Do n't patent human genes' ( April 24 ) . The current mess over patents with no proof of gene function is extremely dangerous . We sympathise with the position that the Medical Research Council has been forced to take and note that it is easy for other countries to take the moral high ground when they have not yet done any scientific work in this area . It is , however , our observation that this is a dispute that has occurred too soon in the genome project : it will generate heat but little light on a critical area for industry . Such National Institutes of Health or MRC patents , even if granted ( possible in the US , very unlikely in Europe ) , are not likely to protect subsequent inventions . Attempts to claim anything but token royalties and fees will certainly result in the NIH being sued by major US drug companies . CEST 's real worry is that these issues are hampering industrial investment in genome research . This is the subject of a CEST lead project involving EC , MRC and European industry . The dispute may also stir up further 'green ' political pressure . By 2000 , this could result in a Europe devoid of a significant biotechnology industry and dependent for advanced healthcare products on the US . Genome technologies offer the first real hope of tackling the diseases of old age , like cancer and arthritis , that will be endemic in the greying Europe of 2010 . That is the real tragedy of this unfortunate international protectionism by the US government . James Watson is to be applauded as one of the few Americans to speak out against this policy .
