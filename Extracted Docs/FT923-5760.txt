a rapid new technique for showing up genetic abnormalities known as chromosome painting promises to make the diagnosis of cancer and certain genetic diseases faster and cheaper the first chromosomal paint to reach the market is the result of a joint venture between the lawrence livermore national laboratory in california and imagenetics a medical diagnostics company based in illinois they have developed fluorescent tags which can specifically label each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes present in normal human cells each tag is a pool of between 10,000 to 100,000 fragments of dna that will identify only the chromosome from which they have been made another chromosome painting kit has been developed in the uk at cambridge university's department of pathology and is being commercialised in collaboration with cambio a biological reagents supplier also based in cambridge the products were developed initially for scientific research doctors are now hoping they receive quick approval from the regulatory authorities in the us and europe for use in routine clinical diagnosis the technology enables scientists quickly and accurately to spot defects within cells such as missing or extra chromosomes or genetic material exchanged incorrectly between two chromosomes the ability to identify genetic changes in evolving cancer cells should help doctors both to direct therapy to specific targets and to analyse the effectiveness of treatment last october imagenetics began commercial production of orange paints for nine chromosomes each paint kit can perform 20 tests and sells for dollars 400 pounds 200 sales took off much more quickly than expected for a product sold for research purposes only and according to the marketing company life technologies the paint has generated record telephone inquiries the initial success recently led imagenetics to offer the original nine chromosomal paints in an additional green colour which will allow two chromosomes to be identified simultaneously within any cell a second set containing nine more chromosomal paints will become available later this year doctors using the paints appear to have no doubt about their usefulness for example in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia genetic material from chromosomes 9 and 22 is mixed together which can be identified using the paints if the leukaemia is progressing rapidly several additional copies of chromosome 8 may be present within a cell painting is proving to be very important as a specific indicator of chromosome 8, says robert jenkins co-director of the cytogenetics laboratory at the mayo clinic this enables us to monitor the progress of leukaemia patients and to diagnose the effectiveness of treatment much more cheaply and more accurately than with conventional methods it costs dollars 500-dollars 600 for each normal bone marrow sample but only dollars 20 plus labour costs for each paint probe i would love the paints to be fda food and drug administration approved for clinical use we have patients we could use them on tomorrow says jenkins in addition to the leukaemia research scientists are developing specific chromosome probes to diagnose and track the aberrations associated with congenital abnormalities joe gray and dan pinkel who first developed the staining techniques at livermore left last year to head a team at the university of california medical centre in san francisco working on such probes for clinical application for example they now have a probe comprising part of chromosome 21 which can determine whether a foetus has downs syndrome and they are making progress with probes to identify solid tumours including breast and prostate cancers tom mozer project manager at imagenetics is hopeful that second-generation forms of chromosomal paints will achieve widespread clinical use the company and its clients are working very closely with the fda to get approval for the clinical use of the second-generation probes any application is a test case however as the fda has never approved a specific cell stain of this type and has only approved one genetic test for leukaemia a separate line of research is continuing at livermore where senior biomedical scientist james tucker is using the staining to examine the genetic consequences for people who have been exposed to radiation he is working with both chernobyl victims and workers at british nuclear fuel's sellafield plant so far blood samples from 14 sellafield workers have been painted over the course of a year to quantify the damage that has accumulated to their white blood cells from long-term occupational exposure to radiation british nuclear fuels says that up to 170 sellafield workers will have been tested by the time the project is finished in 1994 results will be published then
