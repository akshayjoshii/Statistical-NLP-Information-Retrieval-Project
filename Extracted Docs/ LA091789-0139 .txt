I read with great anticipation `` All-Out Against Alcohol '' ( The Times , Sept. 7 ) but was soon disappointed to see that another error was being promulgated . The distinction was repeatedly and incorrectly drawn between `` drugs and alcohol . '' This reference fosters confusion and denial . Alcohol is a drug , legal but nonetheless dangerous . The text could read `` alcohol and other drugs '' or `` drugs , including alcohol . '' Alcohol is a mind-altering chemical , it risks lives and its use can lead to addiction . Therefore , alcohol is a drug . ANNE MARIE ARNERICH Los Angeles
