Ex-Marine Oliver North spent a second day in court sparring with prosecutors in an effort to avoid testifying in the Iran-Contra trial of his ex-boss , retired Rear Adm. John Poindexter . Judge Harold Greene , who has scheduled Poindexter 's trial to open Jan. 22 , did not rule on whether North will be required to appear , but exchanges in court suggested North would be compelled to testify . Of Poindexter 's nationally televised testimony to a congressional committee , North said : `` He was the only one of all the witnesses at the hearing who did n't hang Ollie North out to dry . '' North says his perceptions of the secret arms-and-aid scandal were influenced by Poindexter 's July , 1987 , testimony .
