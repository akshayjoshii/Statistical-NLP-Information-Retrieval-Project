Nolan Ryan pulled his left calf muscle in a minor league exhibition game at Port Charlotte , Fla. , and may not be able to pitch when the season begins in 10 days . Ryan , 42 , who signed a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers last December for a guaranteed $ 2 million , said he felt the pull as he ran to cover first base for Tulsa of the Class AA Texas League , which was playing a Baltimore farm team . Ryan faced three batters , throwing 14 pitches , before departing . Bill Zeigler , the Texas trainer , said he did not believe it was a serious pull .
