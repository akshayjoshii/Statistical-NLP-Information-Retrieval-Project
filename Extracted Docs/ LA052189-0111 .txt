A charging Alaska brown bear was shot and killed by an Exxon cleanup crew working to remove oil from park shorelines fouled by the Exxon Valdez oil spill , the National Park Service reported Saturday . State and federal agencies were investigating the shooting , Park Service spokesman John Quinley said . It is against the law to shoot bears in national parks except in self-defense . Quinley said witnesses reported that the brown bear was shot Friday in Katmai National Park at a distance of 16 feet as the crew members tried to capture an eagle that had oil on it .
