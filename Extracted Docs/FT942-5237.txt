How do businesses get on the Internet ? The answer to this FAQ ( frequently asked question , in 'netspeak ' ) depends to a great extent on the size of an organisation , the number of people who will be using the Internet and how much use they plan to make of it . The basic requirements are simply a personal computer , with a modem , and an account with one of the numerous companies that offer Internet access . Two that offer their services internationally are ANS ( 313 663 7610 ) and SprintLink ( 703 904 2230 ) , both of the US . To take advantage of the latest software , such as Mosaic , which makes access to Internet resources relatively simple , a high-powered PC such as those based on Intel 's 486DX or Pentium chips is recommended . The modem should be designed to send and receive data at 14.4 kilobauds . Slower modems , although cheaper , will keep you waiting interminably if you attempt to access any document containing graphics . Also , to use Mosaic you must have a direct link to the Internet , known as a PPP or Slip account . This enables your computer to exchange data in 'packets ' directly with other computers on the Internet . Prices vary , but in the US they are typically about Dollars 20 per month plus Dollars 2 per hour connect time . Businesses with several users tapping into the Internet may choose to install a dedicated , high-speed telephone line , which makes access more efficient . Routing equipment is needed to link local area networks to the Internet . Security systems may also be desirable . There are numerous books about the Internet . Most , however , are aimed primarily at individual users . An exception is Mary Cronin 's Doing Business on the Internet ; How the Electronic Highway is transforming American Companies , published by Van Nostrand Reinhold at Dollars 29.95 . Written for business managers , rather than computer experts , it offers a readable introduction to the Internet 's business potential .
