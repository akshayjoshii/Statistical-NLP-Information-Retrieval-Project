A Greenpeace ship and a Japanese whaling vessel collided Tuesday off Antarctica in the most serious incident since the environmental group began a campaign a week ago to stop the whale hunt . The Japanese ship Nisshin Maru No . 3 sustained minor damage to its handrails , but the Greenpeace ship Gondwana was not damaged , Greenpeace spokesman Peter Wilkinson said . There were no injuries , he said , speaking by radio telephone from the Gondwana . In Sydney , the Greenpeace coordinator for Antarctica , Lyn Goldsworthy , said the Japanese ship had attached a grappling hook to the 1,435-ton Gondwana , which has a crew of 19 , to pull it out of the way , and that `` in the maneuvering that resulted , the Japanese boat collided with the Gondwana . '' In Tokyo , a whaling official said Tuesday that attempts by the environmental group to block the whale hunt are endangering the lives of crewmen . `` This is terrorism , the same as that opposed by the United States and other countries , '' said Takehiro Takayama of the Tokyo-based Japan Whaling Assn . `` They have no concern about human life . '' Japan has said it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks . Greenpeace contends that the research is an attempt to circumvent a moratorium on commercial whaling imposed by the International Whaling Commission and that most of the whale meat will end up in sushi restaurants in Japan . Wilkinson estimated that Japanese harpooners have already taken between 50 and 55 Minke whales this season , about 10 of them since the Gondwana caught up with the whaling fleet a week ago .
