LABOUR yesterday approved plans for all-women shortlists for the selection of candidates in half the constituencies where the sitting Labour MP is retiring or where there is a good chance of defeating another party . The decision by the National Executive Committee is part of Labour's attempts to increase the number of women in parliament . However Labour MPs last week threw out a proposal that they should vote for at least four women in shadow cabinet elections , compared to the current three .
