Ariel soap powder , produced by Procter & Gamble , was the consumer goods brand with the second largest retail sales last year , beating Unilever's Persil into third place for the first time since 1990 . The top-selling brand in 1993 was Coca-Cola , which clocked up sales of more than Pounds 411m in the UK . Ariel 's sales were Pounds 238m , just ahead of Persil 's Pounds 236m . Advertising spending on Ariel last year was Pounds 22.3m , compared with Persil 's Pounds 18.8m . The two soap giants are battling over Unilever 's recently launched Persil Power . Procter says its rival 's new product rots clothes - a claim vigorously contested by Unilever . The brand ranking figures have been produced by Nielsen , the market research organisation , and are published today in the trade magazine Marketing . They show an overall 3.1 per cent average growth in retail sales for the top 50 brands . The magazine says the figures disprove 'the accepted wisdom that fast-moving consumer goods brands are in trouble ' . The figures were collected too soon to reflect the impact that the launch of Sainsbury 's Classic Cola had on Coca-Cola , but the retailer 's brand was estimated earlier this month to be settling down to about 60 per cent of cola sales in Sainsbury 's stores . The fastest-growing brand last year , with a 93 per cent increase in sales , was Patak 's Indian Foods .
