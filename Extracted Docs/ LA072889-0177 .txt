A former Howard University football coach at the center of a growing scandal over players who apparently played after their four-year college eligibility had expired has said he never intentionally used ineligible players . As many as one-third of the players on the Howard team have been told they have one less year of eligibility than originally thought going into the 1989 season , school officials have said . The eligibility foul-up apparently affects about 30 players recruited for the Bison under former coach Willie Jeffries , Howard deputy counsel Francis Smith said Thursday . Jeffries , contacted Thursday , said he was told he was told three players Howard attorneys have asked him about were eligible . `` The records we were shown indicated they had not played before '' 1984 , he said . When he went to Washington in mid-June to give a deposition to Howard attorneys , `` they asked me about the three players and the financial aid irregularities , '' he said from his Orangeburg , S.C. , office . `` The records we were shown indicated they had not played before . We thought they were redshirt freshmen . To our knowledge they only played four years . They said they had not played in 1983 . '' The school has said it is investigating irregularities in the Bison football program under Jeffries over four years .
