NEXT YEAR 'S world environment summit will be in Manchester in September to tackle implementation of plans agreed at this year 's summit in Rio de Janeiro . It will probably be attended by many heads of government . Britain offered to host the summit after Mr John Major 's visit to Rio . Manchester beat rival bids from London , Edinburgh , Brighton , Reading and Norwich . The timing of the summit could help Manchester 's bid to stage the 2000 Olympic games . The International Olympic Committee will meet in September , when it will have to choose between the main contenders of Manchester , Berlin , Beijing and Sydney . Summit supporters include Central Manchester Development Corporation , the British Council - a government agency - Manchester Metropolitan University , the United Nations Association , Manchester Airport , the north-west business leadership team and Granada Television . The summit will be run by the government , with a core conference of about 500 delegates , but about 2,000 people are expected for two weeks of environment-related fringe events . Mr Graham Stringer , leader of Manchester City Council , said the city would use the summit to stress the green elements of its bid for the 2000 Olympic games . Urban regeneration is one of the criteria the International Olympic Committee will use . Land reclamation , clean technology policies , tree planting and recycling of waste materials are all part of the city 's attempt to impress IOC delegates .
