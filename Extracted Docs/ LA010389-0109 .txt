Vreni Schneider of Switzerland won her sixth World Cup race of the season today and became a clear favorite to dominate the World Alpine Skiing Championships at Vail , Colo. , in 25 days . While Schneider won a women 's slalom , her third of the season , and appears in top form for Jan. 29-Feb. 12 in Vail , American Tamara McKinney was third and also could be heard from at the world championships . But Schneider , the 24-year-old double Olympic gold medalist who looks to be well on her way toward capturing the 1988-89 World Cup , was cautious not to accept premature laurels . `` I 'm still not thinking of ultimate victory because there are still a lot of races left until the end of the season . I still remember last year 's injury , '' she said . Last year , when she captured the Olympic slalom and giant slalom titles , she led the World Cup standings until she had a bad spill in a race at Aspen , Colo. , and tore ligaments in her left knee . Second in today 's race , held in dense fog , was Austrian Monika Maierhofer , in 1:23.81 .
