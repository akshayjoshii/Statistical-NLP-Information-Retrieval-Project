Mr Gilson Ximenes , head of Brazil 's National Coffee Department ( DNC ) , handed in his resignation yesterday to the Minister of Industry and Commerce Mr Elcio Alvares , Reuter reports from Rio de Janeiro . A DNC spokesman said Mr Ximenes stepped down for 'personal reasons ' after nine months in the job . A replacement had not yet been named . His resignation has been linked to that of his former boss , Mr Jose Eduardo Andrade Vieira , who resigned as industry and commerce minister last year to pursue political interests . Reuter also reported from San Jose that Costa Rica yesterday suspended exports of inferior quality coffee , following the example of Colombia and Central American producers last week . Mr Guillermo Canet , executive director of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute ( ICAFE ) , said the aim was to support coffee prices in international markets . The decision , taken by the ICAFE governing board , affected coffee varieties whose prices had fallen below Dollars 80 per 46kg sack .
