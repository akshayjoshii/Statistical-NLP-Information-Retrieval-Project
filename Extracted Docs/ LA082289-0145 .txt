A board member of the Garden Grove Symphony who is strongly opposed to abortion resigned last week after composer and performer James Lee Stanley said that a song he would perform with the orchestra over the weekend had been written out of `` pro-choice '' feelings , according to Dick Hain , the board president . The board member , Ray Romero , `` resigned because of his deep convictions from a religious point of view , '' Hain said . `` We are sad and will miss him . '' Romero , a former vice president of the symphony , said he resigned because he felt `` the stage of symphony should not be used for that purpose . '' Stanley 's position , he said , `` goes against my faith . '' There were no incidents during the performance , part of a free concert Saturday evening that drew about 9,500 to Village Green Park , Hain said . The lyrics of the song , `` The Dancer , '' which has been played on KTWV-FM , make no explicit reference to abortion . Stanley said in an interview last week , however , that he wrote the song out of his conviction that for a pregnant woman , abortion is `` nobody 's choice but yours . '' Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi , marketing director of the orchestra , said he received a number of phone calls before the concert , most of them in support of the group 's invitation to have Stanley perform with them .
