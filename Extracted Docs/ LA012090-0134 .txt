Mercury Savings & Loan , struggling for a year to curb losses , said it was ordered Friday by federal regulators in San Francisco to halt all lending and investment activities . The order does not affect the S & L 's routine customer deposits nor its $ 3-billion loan-servicing portfolio . The S & L also can fill pending commitments for loans and investments , but no new loans or investments can be made . Leonard Shane , chairman of the Huntington Beach-based S & L , said Friday in an interview that he will seek a meeting with regulators as soon as possible to try to ease the restrictions so that Mercury can make single-family home loans of up to $ 500,000 . Mercury is the fourth major S & L in the state this year to be placed under such severe operating restrictions . The others are Valley Federal Savings & Loan in Van Nuys , Imperial Savings Assn . in San Diego and Santa Barbara Savings & Loan . Mercury , which lost $ 5.4 million in the first nine months last year , has nearly run out of tangible capital , which is essentially the amount of cash it has as a final reserve against losses . It said it does n't meet any of the three strict capital tests imposed under a federal law enacted in August to bail out the thrift industry 's deposit insurance fund . Its tangible capital is negligible , only 0.04 % of assets at the end of September -- well below the required 1.5 % level . Its core capital , another test , was 1.54 % , nearly half the required 3 % level . No information is available on the third test , which weighs the risk of the S & L 's loans and investments . Shane , who formerly headed the thrift industry 's chief California and national trade groups , said his institution sent regulators a business plan and a plan for raising capital , but regulators have not yet responded to his proposals . Mercury essentially is reducing assets and trying to sell five Northern California branches in an effort to obtain cash . Industry analysts and consultants are already writing the S & L 's obituary , saying it is essentially insolvent and can be rescued only through a sale . Mercury has hired investment bankers to search for a possible suitor or investor . The supervisory order is `` tantamount to failure , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant in Alexandria , Va . He said the order could be viewed as the regulators ' answer to Shane 's business and capital plans . `` Most institutions can not survive very long under this type of order , '' said Don Murray , a thrift accounting partner at the Irvine office of Deloitte & Touche , a national accounting firm . In similar situations , such letters simply put institutions in a holding pattern until regulators decide what to do with them . Mercury has 24 branches and 800 employees . If Mercury simply plans to sell assets to increase its capital , the restrictions may not hurt it badly , Murray said . But if the S & L had planned to invest proceeds from asset sales to earn capital , then the restrictions pose serious problems , he said . The S & L , which had $ 2.25 billion in assets at the end of September , ran into serious problems with commercial and construction loans in the mid 1980s . Real estate it obtained through foreclosures or bankruptcies left Mercury with a large number of properties that produced no income . At the end of September , its repossessed properties amounted to nearly $ 14 million , or 11.1 % of its assets . Well-managed S & Ls typically keep that figure below 1 % , industry analysts said . In addition , accountants ' estimates of future earnings from servicing loans and of future tax liabilities were inaccurate a year ago . Mercury had to restate its 1988 profit and post a $ 13.8-million loss for that year . Those accounting procedures continued to plague the S & L last year . Though Mercury has n't invested in high-yield junk bonds or other risky investments that placed other S & Ls in jeopardy , its accounting assumptions on future income constituted a risky venture , Ely said .
