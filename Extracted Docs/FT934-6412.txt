A possible new approach to Aids treatment has emerged from laboratory tests at St Bartholomew 's Hospital , London , of a drug being developed to treat cancer . Scotia , a UK pharmaceutical company , said yesterday that its anti-cancer compound EF13 killed white blood cells infected with HIV . The compound did not harm uninfected cells , and made them more resistant to HIV infection . The next stage will be to hold clinical trials for EF13 as an Aids drug , which could take several years to com-plete . The drug is the lithium salt of a fatty acid extract from evening primrose oil . It is believed to kill infected cells by generating lethal levels of free radicals . Markets , Page 40
