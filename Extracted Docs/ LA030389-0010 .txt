Amnesty International accused Iraq and five other countries of the widespread use of death squads . The London-based group told the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva that most death squads , while appearing to operate independently , actually are set up by government security forces and are directed and manned by soldiers or police . The human rights group singled out Iraq as having the worst reputation for use of the squads -- `` clearly and incontrovertibly , ( it ) presents a situation of the most flagrant and massive violation of human rights '' -- but it also named Colombia , El Salvador , Peru , Ethiopia and Burma .
