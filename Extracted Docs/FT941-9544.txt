The board of Maclean Hunter , the Canadian publishing and broadcast group , will meet this week to consider its response to a takeover bid worth at least CDollars 2.8bn ( USDollars 2.1bn ) from Rogers Communications of Toronto . Rogers , which is Canada 's biggest cable TV distributor , ended two weeks of speculation last Friday by offering CDollars 17 per share , plus a portion of the proceeds from the sale of MH 's US cable TV franchises , if they realise more than CDollars 1.5bn after expenses . Rogers has already bought an 8.3 per cent stake in MH on the open market . Mr Robert Furse , Maclean Hunter 's chief financial officer , said the company 's advisers met over the weekend to consider the Rogers bid and other meetings would be necessary to formulate a response . MH is unlikely to give its unqualified approval . Expectations that the Rogers offer is not the last word were reflected in a 38 per cent rise in MH 's share price last Friday to CDollars 17.38 . The alternatives being explored by MH include alliances with other companies , a recapitalisation and the sale of its cable TV business . Among the uncertainties facing Rogers is whether the MH board will allow the bid . MH 's shareholder rights plan makes a takeover all but impossible unless it is permitted by the board . Mr Ted Rogers , Rogers ' entrepreneurial founder and chief executive , insisted that the bid would not be raised . 'If we were not successful , someone would have to come in with an ego , and overpay . ' Rogers has arranged financing of CDollars 2.7bn . Mr Rogers claims the merger is needed to create a Canadian multi-media group powerful enough to stand up to big foreign predators , as well as the domestic telephone industry . 'If we 're all small and timid in this country , we 'll be overwhelmed , ' he said .
