American experts who inspected Soviet psychiatric hospitals said today that previous wide-scale abuses have been reduced , but mental institutions are still being used by some Soviet authorities to punish political dissidents . The 26-member American team was led by Robert Farrand , deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights , and Loren Roth , professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine . The American team included 14 psychiatrists , one psychologist , two lawyers , two specialists in human rights and six interpreters . They were allowed to visit a series of Soviet psychiatric hospitals from Feb. 26 to March 12 , interviewing 15 patients and 12 former patients who had recently been released by Soviet authorities . Of the 12 who had been released , the American team found that 11 had been confined for reasons that were essentially political , including the distribution of literature banned by Soviet authorities . The American team concluded : `` There are some signs of movement to bring legal and psychiatric practices closer to those found in the West . Yet , there are also many signs that the transition is far from complete . '' Among the abuses the American team found was the use of antipsychotic medications to treat patients who were thought to have `` delusions of reformism '' or `` anti-Soviet thoughts . '' One drug , called sulfazine , which causes severe pain , fever and loss of muscular control , was used `` for punitive rather than therapeutic purposes , '' the American team reported . A Soviet response to the U.S. report said the government is writing guidelines to restrict the use of such drugs . The response conceded that some shortcomings in mental institutions may still exist , but suggested that the American team erred by accepting , at face-value , statements made by every Soviet mental patient who was interviewed .
