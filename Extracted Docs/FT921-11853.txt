NORTH KOREA yesterday rejected a South Korean proposal for early inspections of suspected nuclear facilities in both Koreas , South Korean officials said , AP reports from Seoul . But North Korea said the issue could be discussed after a meeting of the South and North Korean prime ministers scheduled for February 18-21 . The Communist government 's move amplified worries in the south that the north was trying to gain time to develop nuclear arms . A South Korean newspaper yesterday quoted an unidentified government official as saying intelligence reports indicate North Korea may be able to start reprocessing nuclear fuel as early as May . Once reprocessing begins , there is a danger North Korea could hide its nuclear weapons programme , the paper said . 'Concerns are being raised because the north expressed its intention to refuse pilot inspections , ' Mr Lee Dong-bok , a South Korean negotiator , said after meeting North Korean officials .
