SHELL , the oil company , will not be prosecuted over the deaths of 11 men in a North Sea helicopter crash , the Crown Office has confirmed . Pilot error was blamed for the tragedy in March last year when a Super Puma helicopter plunged into the sea on a two-minute flight from Shell's Cormorant Alpha platform . But , after a fatal accident inquiry in Aberdeen , Sheriff Alexander Jessop found that Shell had contributed to the loss of life . The Crown Office confirmed that nobody would be prosecuted because 'it would not be in the public 's interest ' .
