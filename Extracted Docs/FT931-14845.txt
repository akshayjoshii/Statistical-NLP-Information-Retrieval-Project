A US company is building a Dollars 60m plant in Trinidad to produce iron carbide from iron ore imported from Brazil . The Nucor Corporation of North Carolina says the plant will produce 320,000 tonnes of iron carbide per year , and that the material will be exported to the US for use in the company 's steel mills . Construction of the plant will begin in the first quarter of this year , with production scheduled to start in the last quarter of next year . Nucor says the Trinidad plant will be the first to use the company 's patented process to convert iron ore into iron carbide using natural gas . The iron carbide plant will be fired by locally produced natural gas , and will be located at the Point Lisas industrial complex in south central Trinidad .
