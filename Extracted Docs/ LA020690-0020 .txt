A construction crew accidentally damaged three underground telephone cables Monday afternoon in El Cajon , disrupting service for several hours to as many as 60,000 East County Pacific Bell customers , a telephone company spokesman said . Spokesman Tom McNaghten said customers in El Cajon , Lakeside , Santee , Alpine and Pine Valley were affected when one cable was severed and two others damaged by a private construction crew digging in the 1100 block of Murray Drive , across from Grossmont High School . Callers from outside the area were unable to get through , while callers in the East County communities were likewise unable to place long-distance calls . Local calls made in a community -- within El Cajon , for example -- were able to get through , though calls placed between communities -- such as from Santee to El Cajon -- in many instances were not , McNaghten said . The cables were damaged at 12:50 p.m. , and partial service was restored to most areas by 6:30 p.m . The telephone company expected to have full service restored to all areas by 8 a.m. today , the spokesman said . Calls to emergency 911 numbers were not disturbed . A spokeswoman for the El Cajon Police Department said some 911 calls were delayed slightly , though response was not a major problem .
