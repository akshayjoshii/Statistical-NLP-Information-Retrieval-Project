'' I think everyone who has the means should be interested in collecting , '' said Sotheby 's chairman John L. Marion . Everyone ? Is this man greedy or what ? As Sotheby 's premier auctioneer in New York , Marion has knocked down the world 's three most expensive paintings : Vincent van Gogh 's `` Irises '' ( $ 53.9 million ) , Pablo Picasso 's `` Yo Picasso '' ( $ 47.9 million ) and Picasso 's `` Au Lapin Agile '' ( $ 40.7 million ) . He has also sold the three priciest works by living artists : Willem de Kooning 's `` Interchange '' ( $ 20.7 million ) and Jasper Johns ' `` False Start '' ( $ 17 million ) and `` Two Flags '' ( $ 12.1 million ) . But Marion is not content . Because these big sales get all the press , they lead to the misconception that auctions are a sport for the ultrarich , he said in a recent interview . In fact , more than half of the 200,000-plus lots sold in a year at Sotheby 's go for less than $ 5,000 ; a quarter of them sell for under $ 1,000 . Marion cites these figures repeatedly in `` The Best of Everything : The Insider 's Guide to Collecting -- for Every Taste and Every Budget '' ( Simon & Schuster : $ 19.95 ) , a new book he wrote with Christopher Andersen . While the book is well stocked with anecdotes about the rich and famous , the central message is that you do n't have to be Malcolm Forbes to become a smart player in the auction game . And smart is definitely the operative word here . `` Do your homework , '' Marion counsels in one chapter : `` Check out the auction house 's reputation , '' `` study the catalogue , '' `` check out the merchandise , '' `` ask the experts , '' `` attend an auction just to observe . '' He also discusses nine criteria for assessing value : authenticity , condition , rarity , historic importance and provenance , size , medium , subject matter , fashion and aesthetic quality . Furthermore , Marion exhorts readers to `` set a limit '' on the amount they will bid before setting foot in an auction room . `` Buying on impulse is the single biggest mistake any collector can make , '' he writes . If this is unexpected advice from a man who wants everyone to collect the things that Sotheby 's sells , it 's actually good for business . Sophisticated buyers are the best auction customers in the long run . They do n't stop buying when their homes are furnished . They refine their collections , branch out , trade up and believe their acquisitive passion improves their quality of life . In short , they become connoisseurs who reap the rewards of making educated decisions . And in collecting , `` knowledge is truly power , '' Marion said . Why buy a new rug or piece of furniture when for roughly the same price you can have a more appealing old one that is likely to rise in value , he asked . If you build a coherent collection of things you love , you will be surrounded by objects that have `` special meaning '' because you took the trouble to find them and learn about them . But what 's available to the aspiring collector who lacks Donald Trump 's bank account ? Marion lists African and Latin American art , American furniture , English salt-glazed stoneware , classic cars and the whole field of collectibles among `` best bets '' in his book . Collectors do n't have to buy at auction , but Marion said that they are missing high-quality objects and educational opportunities if they do n't . `` Education is the prime reason for our success , '' Marion said . Dealers used to be the primary educators of collectors , but now the major auction houses have taken over part of that role by publishing catalogues , making appraisals and offering a range of customer services , he said . As collectors have multiplied , they have edged dealers out of auctions . While dealers once bought 60 % of the goods offered at a typical auction and added these treasures to their inventories , they now purchase about 40 % and many of those sales are ordered by specific clients . Despite the participation of more and more people , misconceptions about auctions persist , Marion said , and that 's what persuaded him to write a book . He wants his readers to know that you do n't have to spend a lot of money to buy at auction , you can walk in off the street , you can ask questions without fear of ridicule and you can understand what 's going on . But what if you sneeze , scratch your nose or wave at a friend ? Will the auctioneer think you are bidding on a Renoir ? `` Only if you are Norton Simon . ''
