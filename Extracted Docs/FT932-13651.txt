BARCLAYS ' New Zealand subsidiary announced an 80 per cent rise in profits from NZDollars 6.1m to a record NZDollars 11m ( Pounds 3.85m ) last year . Mr Warren Salisbury , general manager , said the result reflected increased revenues , a drop in overheads , and improved processing systems . The division cut its staff by 20 to 40 people . Mr Salisbury said most of the revenue came from the asset book , which he said was valued at between NZDollars 1bn and NZDollars 1.5bn . Barclays bought the swaps book of DFC New Zealand , the collapsed former state-owned investment bank , in 1991 . The New Zealand branch trades in the short term money market , and is active in the foreign exchange forwards and swaps markets , but does not deal in the spot New Zealand dollar .
