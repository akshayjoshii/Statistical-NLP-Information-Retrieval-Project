EUROPEAN and US drugs groups are threatening to dominate the world 's market , leaving their Japanese counterparts trailing , according to a study * by Datamonitor , the London-based strategy consultants . In particular , the European groups ' dominance will be driven by their innovative research and development , new products and international marketing strength . Only three Japanese companies , Takeda , Sankyo and Shionogi , are among the world 's top 25 drugs groups , and none is in the top 10 . Japan ran a trade deficit of more than Pounds 800m in 1989 . Repeated price cuts implemented by the Ministry of Health and Welfare have seriously handicapped the Japanese industry . While drug prices in the US increased by 40 per cent between 1982 and 1988 , those in Japan fell 39 per cent . In 1991 alone , Shionogi and Fujisawa suffered average price cuts of 9.5 per cent and 9 per cent . respectively . Japanese groups have been hit disproportionately because of their dependence on the domestic market . Takeda , the largest Japanese group , generates 98.6 per cent of its turnover in Japan . Japanese spending on research and development has doubled in the past 10 years , though sales increased only 50 per cent . The Datamonitor report warns , however , that the Japanese R & D push may come too late , because of increasing penetration of the Japanese market by western drugs groups . This , it argues , is likely to accelerate a consolidation of the Japanese industry . * The Japanese pharmaceutical market 1992-1995 , Datamonitor , 106 Baker Street , London W1M 1LA , 071 625 85 48 .
