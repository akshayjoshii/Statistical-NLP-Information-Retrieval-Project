Work began last week on a $ 4.2-million computerized traffic control system for the heavily congested streets in and around Westwood . Known as ATSAC , or Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control , the system is similar to one that has cut intersection delays by 20 % and travel time by 13 % in the Coliseum area , said S.E . Rowe , general manager of the city Transportation Department . Using electronic sensors implanted in the pavement , ATSAC relays information about the flow of traffic to a control center in City Hall , where computers regulate the timing of traffic signals . The system is financed by fees paid by developers whose projects contribute to traffic congestion . The Westwood ATSAC area connects traffic signals in the area bounded by the San Diego Freeway on the west , Beverly Hills on the east , Olympic Boulevard on the south and Montana Avenue , Wilshire Boulevard and UCLA on the north . `` By next March , West Los Angeles will have the first installment of a truly space-age traffic control network , '' City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said . `` I look forward to better traffic conditions here and throughout the city with the implementation of ATSAC .
