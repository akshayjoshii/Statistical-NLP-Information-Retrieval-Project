Taiwan will send a delegation to China to gather details on the deaths of 24 Taiwanese tourists in an arson case that has set back detente between the two sides , AP reports from Taipei . Mr Huang Kun-huei , chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council , told reporters that the delegation would leave for China in a week . The 24 were found dead on March 31 in a burned-out boat on a lake in China 's Zhejiang province . Earlier , Taiwan had demanded an open trial for three suspects arrested by Chinese authorities last week and more details on the investigation before it would accept China 's suggestion to send a delegation . Beijing 's semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits sent a letter to its Taiwanese counterpart over the weekend promising that China would answer questions about the case , Mr Huang said . 'The most important thing now is to find the truth and hammer out compensation for families of the victims . . . so it is still imperative to hold talks on the incident , ' Mr Huang added . The case has prompted Taiwanese groups to call for a boycott on tourism to the mainland and for a suspension of new investment projects . It has also heightened the impression in Taiwan that Beijing remains an unreliable partner .
