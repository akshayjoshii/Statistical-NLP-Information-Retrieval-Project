South Korea yesterday proposed that talks with North Korea on mutual nuclear inspections be resumed next Tuesday , writes John Burton in Seoul . It is unclear , however , whether Pyongyang will accept the proposal since Seoul is suggesting that the talks should be held through the bilateral Joint Nuclear Control Commission . North Korea wants the talks conducted by special envoys who would also arrange a summit meeting between the leaders of the two Koreas .
