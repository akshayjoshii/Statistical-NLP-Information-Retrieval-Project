The Pico Rivera City Council has approved an ordinance under which alcohol can be sold at service stations if the business obtains a special city permit . In 1986 , the council banned alcohol sales at all service stations . But last year , the Legislature passed a law making such blanket bans illegal , so the City Council complied with the state 's action through the ordinance allowing alcohol sales only with a city permit . Even under the city permit , issued with the approval of the Planning Commission , alcohol sales would be restricted . Alcohol display and sale areas would be limited , the percentage of alcohol sales could not exceed the sales of non-alcohol products and the hours of alcohol sales would be limited .
