AMERICAN EXPRESS and American Telephone and Telegraph ( AT & T ) , two corporate giants under pressure from nimble rivals , have joined forces in an attempt to woo the US small business community . They announced yesterday that AT & T 's corporate calling card and the American Express corporate charge card would be jointly marketed to small businesses as a single entity . The system will allow small businesses which are American Express corporate card members to charge AT & T telecommunications expenses along with other out-of-office expenses and get a single monthly statement . American Express is under pressure from the Visa and Mastercard credit card operations .
