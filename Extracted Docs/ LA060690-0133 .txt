And so , 200 years later , the battle for the village of San Juan Capistrano continues . The padres fought the wilderness to establish their mission ; today the villagers fight the developers and politicians to protect the wilderness and the village . Has this saga come full circle ? Are the padres and the villagers again fighting a concrete wilderness -- e.g. , the Franciscan Plaza , traffic signals that do n't relieve the traffic congestion , meadows and hillsides designated for high-density housing tracts , shopping malls and a new civic center that would further destroy our environment and mission village ? As more wondrous artifacts are discovered , the politicians voice much concern , then proceed to cover them up with monstrous buildings . Should they not be more concerned with our quality of life ? Although ours may seem a small conflict , it is significant worldwide , for we , as residents of San Juan and citizens of this planet , must learn from our lessons of the past to preserve and protect our future .
