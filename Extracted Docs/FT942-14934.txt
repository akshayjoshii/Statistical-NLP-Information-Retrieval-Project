Following the small interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank last Thursday - a quarter-point off both the Lombard and the discount rates , taking them to 6.5 and 5.5 per cent respectively - the bund market will this week focus on the March money supply figures . As Mr Adolf Rosenstock of the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt put it , the chance to cut the whole interest rate salami will depend on the development of broad money growth in the months ahead . If the M3 number for March , due to be published later in the week , turns out at less than 15 per cent , it is likely to be encouraging for the listless German government securities market . 'Only if the indicator of long-term performance does calm down again - that is , if M3 does not indicate a preponderant risk of resurgent inflation after 1995 - in conjunction with a strong economic recovery , will the Bundesbank find scope for lowering rates more , ' Rosenstock argues . The green light will only be given when the trend growth in M3 is back to around 7 per cent , he says . This would compare with the 4 to 6 per cent target for the year which was exceeded so dramatically in January and February , when M3 grew at 21.2 and 17.6 per cent respectively , on an annualised , seasonally-adjusted basis .
