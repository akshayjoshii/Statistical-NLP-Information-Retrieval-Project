This city has made a comeback . Situated by the Galena River near the Mississippi in northwestern Illinois , Galena was the Midwest 's business and cultural center in the mid-1800s . People exchanged local produce and ores for luxury goods brought up the river from the South . Main Street , lined with two- and three-story buildings , was dominated by DeSoto House , a hotel built in 1855 that accommodated traders , tourists and , on one occasion , Abraham Lincoln . Ulysses S. Grant , who lived in Galena , had a Victorian house on the hill overlooking town . Galena 's fortunes changed when local politicians told the railroad to build its terminal elsewhere . River boats , they believed , were all the transportation that Galena needed . So the iron horse steamed into Chicago , then just a small town . Population Moves Chicago 's star subsequently rose and Galena 's faded . When the mines gave out , much of Galena 's population moved on and the town was all but forgotten . But after a century of neglect , Galena is thriving , with visitors attracted by the town 's turn-of-the-century quaintness . Galena was featured in the recent hit film `` Field of Dreams . '' A refurbished DeSoto House is often full , and Main Street 's storefronts , all restored , offer antiques as well as reasonably priced clothing , personal accessories and home furnishings . Main Street runs from north to south , with shops concentrated in a five-block span . Begin at either end , but do n't miss these : The Toy Soldier Collection ( DeSoto House , 228 S. Main St. ) sells miniature warriors ( from $ 40 ) outfitted in Napoleonic , Civil War and other uniforms , plus diminutive Grants . Owner W. Paul Le Greco , a Grant look-alike , is well known for portraying Galena 's most famous native son . Casual Clothing Winona Knits ( 224 S.
