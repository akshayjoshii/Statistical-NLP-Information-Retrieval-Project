Communist rebels killed an elderly American rancher on the central Philippine island of Masbate after he refused to pay `` revolutionary taxes , '' officials said . The victim , Stewart Frank Raab , was the second American killed by Filipino rebels in a month and the fifth in the past year . Raab , 76 , was seized Tuesday by about 30 New People 's Army guerrillas at his ranch near Milagros , 240 miles southeast of Manila , a military spokesman said by telephone from Masbate . Raab , who was born in the Philippines when it was still an American colony , had been paying `` revolutionary taxes '' -- or protection money -- until the rebels increased the fee to $ 34,000 a year .
