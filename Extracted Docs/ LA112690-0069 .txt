A new genetic study shows most of the 30 to 50 endangered panthers in the Everglades are not purebred Florida panthers at all , but hybrids that may not be entitled to protection under the Endangered Species Act . Scientists compared the panthers ' cells and found two distinct families . One was apparently descended from South American pumas set free in the 1950s .
