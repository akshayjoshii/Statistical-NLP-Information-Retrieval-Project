When about 350 members of the Andy Griffith Show Appreciation Society got together over the weekend in Winston-Salem , N.C. , for their annual convention , they took a trip 35 miles up the road to Mt . Airy , said to be the inspiration for some of the spots in the show 's fictional town of Mayberry . What they noticed right off were some differences . Aunt Bea 's eatery and Floyd 's Barbershop had different names , but they did find a Snappy Grill on Main Street . Differences or not , one member , Linda Stewart of Dallas , said of the visit : `` I can die happy now . Mostly I can relate to the life style , because we sit on the porch at home and rock , go to church , even eat the same kind of foods . I ca n't relate to shows today because we do n't have cocktails every five minutes . '' Stewart , 47 , has watched and videotaped all 200-plus episodes of the show that aired on CBS 1960-68 .
