Sir , It was with a strong feeling of deja vu that I read your article about Companies House which stated that 'supporters of civil service privatisation have long argued that Companies House is an ideal candidate for privatisation . . . ' ( 'Companies House review is ordered ' , July 25 ) . Nearly 10 years ago the government announced that it planned to privatise the Companies Registration Office Office ( as Companies House was then called ) . The proposal did not succeed because , under the First Companies Directive ( EEC Directive 68/151 ) , the information which is held by Companies House has to be made available to inquirers by post 'at a price not exceeding the administrative cost thereof ' . Where profit is forbidden by law , whence privatisation ? Edwin Fleming , 55 Kylemore Avenue , Mossley Hill , Liverpool L18 4PZ
