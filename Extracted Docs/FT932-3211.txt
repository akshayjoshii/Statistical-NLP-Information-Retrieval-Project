COLES MYER , the Australian retailer , has sold for NZDollars 128.2m ( USDollars 69.6m ) its remaining 38.1 per cent stake in Progressive Enterprises , the New Zealand supermarket operator it bought in 1988 then floated in March last year . Mr Peter Bartels , chief executive , said the buyer was Foodland Associates , the Western Australian supermarket group , at NZDollars 2.00 a share . Mr Bartels said funds raised from the sale would be used to expand Coles Myer 's remaining interests in New Zealand which included the Kmart and Katies chains and retail property investments . 'Maintaining a minority interest in Progressive Enterprises does not sit well with our future strategy in New Zealand where we are committed to expanding strongly in the non-food retail sector , ' he said Mr Bartels said Foodland was already a significant participant in New Zealand supermarkets , owning the Rattray and Countdown chains . He said two of Coles Myer 's four directors on the Progressive board would step down immediately and the other two would step down on completion of the sale which required approval from New Zealand regulatory authorities .
