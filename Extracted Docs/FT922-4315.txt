THREE senior government forensic scientists 'took the law into their own hands ' and concealed evidence that could have cleared Miss Judith Ward of IRA bombing charges at her trial 18 years ago , the Court of Appeal said yesterday . The court was giving judgment at the end of Miss Ward 's appeal against conviction for the M62 army coach bombing , in which 12 people died , and two other explosions . Lord Justice Steyn said : 'On the scientific evidence deployed against her , Miss Ward did not have a fair trial . ' Mr Douglas Higgs , the late Mr Walter Elliott and Mr George Berryman , all employed by the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment , withheld material evidence that might have changed the course of the trial , he said . They misled 'the prosecution and the defence in order to promote a cause which they had made their own , namely that Miss Ward had been in contact with nitroglycerine ' . The court formally quashed her convictions as 'unsafe and unsatisfactory ' . West Yorkshire police , who investigated the M62 bombing , Director of Public Prosecution staff and counsel advising them , psychiatrists who provided evidence about Miss Ward and the forensic scientists for the prosecution were all heavily criticised by the court for withholding evidence . Miss Ward was freed on bail three weeks ago after the Crown conceded that her confessions and scientific evidence purporting to show that she had handled explosives were unreliable . Mrs Barbara Mills QC , the DPP , said afterwards : 'Disclosure is in the forefront of prosecutors ' minds . The public is rightly concerned , but the circumstances and atmosphere of 18 years ago were quite different . ' The Home Office said it would study the judgment before deciding what action , if any , should be taken against the government scientists .
