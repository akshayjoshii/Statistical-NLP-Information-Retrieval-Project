Drivers seeking better access to the Pavilion shopping center near Dana Point Harbor may have an easier time soon . The city 's Traffic Improvement Commission last week approved two concessions sought by the shopping center 's merchants : a left-turn break through the median from northbound Street of the Golden Lantern and legal U-turns on Dana Point Harbor Drive . Funding for the median project will most likely be shared by the city and the merchants , according to Bob Sergeant , city engineer . Merchants from the center , at the intersection of Street of the Golden Lantern and Dana Point Harbor Drive , had complained to the city for several months that access to their shops had been limited because no turn breaks existed in the street median except for the entrance to residential areas near the center .
