WESTERN Europe must tackle high unemployment if it is to compete in the modern world economy , Mr Gary Becker , Nobel economics prize winner said yesterday , Reuter reports from Madrid . 'Europe has an essentially skilled work-force but its jobless rate is unnecessarily high and must be overcome for it to succeed as well as it might , ' Mr Becker told a business seminar . Western Europe 's jobless rate has been running at an average 9 per cent over the past five years . Mr Becker , who won last year 's Nobel economics prize , said that in a free trade era countries with the best-trained people will compete most efficiently , provided companies are not stifled by employment taxes . He said a serious by-product of unemployment is that those out of work are not getting trained , and they lose skills . 'The unemployed have no opportunity to learn on the job , and the skills they learned on the job are gradually lost . '
