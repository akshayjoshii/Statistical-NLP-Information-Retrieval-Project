One of the Tory Party 's problems is that so many of its ministers seem to look and talk alike : all part of the same Cambridge mafia . There is no-one distinctive like the old transport minister , Ernie Marples : even Norman Tebbit , who had some claim to be different , is on his way out . Yet there is a case for saying that every government needs a Marples . Labour has one , also connected with transport , in John Prescott , the pugnacious MP for Hull East . There was a time when he looked an embarrassment to some of his smoother and more revisionist colleagues . But Prescott has stuck to his task and almost everyone must now recognise his blunt tones . In one way , however , he has trimmed , promising to spend money 'only when resources allow ' . At the weekend , Prescott pledged to take the eccentrically unreliable Docklands Light Railway back into public ownership immediately after the election . There would , of course , be handsome compensation for the London Docklands Development Corporation , the government-sponsored body to which the railway is supposed to be handed over shortly as a first step towards privatisation . Prescott offered Pounds 2 instead of the Pounds 1 that the LDDC is said to be paying .
