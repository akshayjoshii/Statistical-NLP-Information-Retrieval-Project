Kimon Beazlie , 46 , a former Hollywood costume designer who with four other AIDS patients was profiled Sunday in the Los Angeles Times Magazine , has died after a yearlong battle with the disease , according to friends . Beazlie , of Los Feliz , appeared on the cover of the magazine and was one of the subjects of an article titled `` To Live and Die in L.A. , '' about the crisis in AIDS health care in Los Angeles County . He was admitted to the Chris Brownlie Hospice for AIDS patients two weeks ago , soon after giving a short , final interview for the story , and died early Monday . Beazlie , an avid amateur rock climber who was born and raised in Hawaii , once made $ 80,000 a year creating costumes for movies and television . After developing early symptoms in the fall of 1988 , Beazlie became ill in July of last year with Kaposi 's sarcoma , a rare skin cancer associated with AIDS . In the magazine article he told of being forced to wait seven weeks , because of overcrowded conditions , before being admitted to the AIDS outpatient clinic at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center . Beazlie was treated at the clinic until this summer , when he dropped out of therapy because of frustration with the quality of medical care and his own worsening condition . For several months , until his health deteriorated , he was a part-time volunteer at Being Alive , a nonprofit group run by AIDS patients . Shortly before dying , Beazlie arranged for his own cremation . No services are scheduled . A friend said his remains will be flown to Hawaii , where Beazlie is survived by his father , Horace , and mother , Natsuko ; a brother , David , and two sisters , Karla and Nadine .
