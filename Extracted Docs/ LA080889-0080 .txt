Deputy Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer was elected leader of the ruling Labor Party today , placing him in line to succeed New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange . Lange , who announced his resignation Monday , is expected to formally hand over the prime minister 's office to Palmer later today when they meet Governor General Paul Reeves . Political analysts say Palmer , a 47-year-old lawyer , represents the center of the party , which has been hit in recent months by factional fighting . Housing and Health Minister Helen Clark will succeed him , making her the highest ranking woman in New Zealand politics . `` I 'm so pleased the heritage of the party is locked into the people who will honor it , '' Lange told reporters after announcing Palmer 's election in a party caucus . Asked for the voting numbers , he said , `` That 's a matter which I do n't know . '' Lange announced his resignation after his party 's members in the House of Assembly voted to return to the Cabinet former Finance Minister Roger Douglas , his one-time ally but now archrival . He fired Douglas last December in a dispute over the pace and scope of economic reform in New Zealand . Lange , 47 , who underwent a heart operation last year , also cited health as a reason for quitting . He said he intends to remain in the House of Assembly , or Parliament . In 1984 , Lange stirred controversy when his government denied permission for U.S. warships to enter New Zealand ports because Washington refused to confirm or deny whether specific ships carried atomic weapons . On Monday , before Palmer 's election , State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington , `` We are hopeful . . . that Prime Minister Lange 's successor will reassess New Zealand 's anti-nuclear policy .
