John Snow and John Price , and that 's just for openers . . .Fred Rumsey will be on hand as first change . Any cricketing capitalists who feel up to facing the ex-England pace bowlers , should call John Ayling on 071-439 6070 . He 's drumming up an FT Business XI to take on the Lord 's Taverners , under former Test captain Mike Denness , at the Oval on Saturday June 27 . First come , first picked , he says - although WPP 's Martin Sorrell is already booked to play ( not necessarily in the slips ) . The only catch , before the game starts at least , is that playing will cost a charitable donation of at least Pounds 2,000 .
