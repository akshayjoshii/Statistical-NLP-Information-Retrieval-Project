Air Canada has called off its two-year fight with rival Canadian International Airlines , saying 'it is time for both of us to move forward and focus on rebuilding our industry ' . Air Canada said it was ending all litigation 'that would preclude ' PWA , Canadian 's parent company , from concluding a CDollars 246m ( USDollars 187m ) deal with AMR , parent of American Airlines . AMR had insisted Canadian withdraw from the Gemini ticket reservation system and join its own Sabre system as a condition of injecting CDollars 246m equity . But Air Canada , a co-founder of Gemini with PWA , maintained Canadian Airlines was contracted as a Gemini shareholder until 1997 . Air Canada would not add to the statement . But the industry said it meant the court battle over Canadian 's membership in the Gemini reservation system was over . At the same time , the federal government said it would soon announce arrangements for Air Canada to have access to Japan and Hong Kong - two destinations already served by Canadian . Air Canada had failed to persuade the public that it should become the sole Canadian international carrier and Canadian Airlines should 'concentrate on the domestic market ' , said Mr Stephen Garmaise , analyst with First Marathon Securities in Toronto . 'We 'll continue to have two international carriers and Canadian may be ready to pay CDollars 10m to CDollars 20m to exit from Gemini . ' PWA recently won renewal of CDollars 100m in government loan guarantees . A deal with Air Canada and the equity infusion would allow it to move ahead with a financial restructuring , with massive dilution facing existing stockholders .
