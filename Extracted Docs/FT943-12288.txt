Sir , Roland Adburgham 's review ( 'MPs back wind farms for Wales ' , July 21 ) of the Welsh affairs committee 's report on wind farms in Wales picks up issues which prompt me to point out that local interest in hydro-power schemes differs sharply from that in wind . For example , modern hydro schemes are essentially below ground and so do not visually intrude on the landscape ; their economics are improving to the point where state subsidies are not needed ; and investment is becoming increasingly indigenous . Furthermore , there is potential for many schemes of a size sufficient to meet nearby demands . Renewable energy sources are as variable in their implications as those regarded as conventional .
