I read with great interest the article `` Urban River Seeks to Find Its Way '' ( Nov. 12 ) . Considering that the San Diego River once flowed unimpeded from the mountains to the sea , it 's quite distressing to accept a river that has since been bombarded by civilization . Fortunately we are witnessing a renewed interest in the San Diego River . What is desperately needed , however , is a comprehensive restoration plan which addresses land use , wildlife management , recreational opportunities , flood control and protection of water quality . Restoration of this once beautiful river will require two basic commitments . First and foremost is the dedication of open space along the banks of the river for preservation of wildlife habitat and public access . Second , a river management entity must be established to carefully balance wildlife management , recreational interests and water quality . Anyone who has traveled to San Antonio or Austin , Tex. , realizes that a properly managed urban river can represent an aesthetically pleasing environment with numerous recreational opportunities . Imagine a linear park with bike paths extending along the banks of the San Diego River from Mission Bay to the Cleveland National Forest . Carrying that thought one step further , imagine if the water quality could be improved to the point where it was suitable for fishing , boating and irrigation . A comprehensive river management approach is far preferable to piecemeal mitigation of individual development projects in the flood plain . PETER MacLAGGAN San Diego
