The Exxon oil spill has continued to kill animals and devour pristine waters off southern Alaska , and officials tracking the oil said Wednesday it has covered 9,600 square miles . The animal death toll also has continued to mount . Workers have collected 22,868 dead , oily birds and 743 sea otters , the U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service reported . That represents a fraction of the wildlife killed by the oil , and regional director Walter Stieglitz said : `` We 're still counting its victims . '' More than $ 155 million has been spent by Exxon and the state and federal governments on cleanup since March 24 , when the Exxon Valdez ran aground and spilled about 11 million gallons of oil into waters south of the Valdez oil terminal . Alaska Gov . Steve Cowper appointed a task force Wednesday to investigate the spill and recommend ways to prevent future spills . A new 5-cent tax on each barrel of oil from Alaska will finance the panel , which is made up of five Alaska residents , a former science adviser to three presidents and an environmental scientist . Oil tracker Marshal Kendziorek of the Department of Environmental Conservation has mapped the spill , and his documents show that 9,600 square miles of southern Alaska coastal waters have been affected by the oil . That makes the country 's largest oil spill as big in size as the state of Vermont , he said . Oil has spread for eight weeks and has been tracked down Shelikof Strait to Wide Bay , 475 miles from where the Exxon Valdez ran aground , Kendziorek said .
