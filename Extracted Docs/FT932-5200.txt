Could Tim Hely Hutchinson , founder of Headline Books , be the new Paul Hamlyn of British publishing ? Having just agreed a Pounds 49m takeover of the 125-year-old publishers Hodder & Stoughton , he was refreshingly modest when Observer popped the question yesterday . He stresses that he is not nearly as innovative as the fabulously wealthy Hamlyn , founder of Octopus Books and creator of a whole new consumer publishing sector . ' I 'm only a manager , ' says Hely Hutchinson , whose father , the Earl of Donoughmore , will be non-executive chairman of the enlarged group . Whereas Hamlyn is reckoned to be worth Pounds 180m , Hely Hutchinson only owns 3 per cent of Headline , which just about makes him a millionaire . But he is almost as young as Hamlyn was when he sold his first business to Cecil King 's IPC in 1964 and thereby coined his initial million . Given that he is nearly 30 years younger than 67-year-old Hamlyn , and probably running the second largest independent publisher after Macmillan , young Tim is not doing too badly .
