Barred by China , Pope John Paul II will become the first pontiff to fly over the Soviet Union on his trip to Asia next month , the Vatican said Friday . The Italian airline Alitalia received permission for a route for the papal plane over Yugoslavia , Hungary , the Soviet Union and Japan for the Oct. 6 flight to Seoul , the first stop on the 10-day trip , according to Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro . The airline announced last month that China 's Communist government denied permission for the plane to fly over China . The government did not give an explanation . China severed diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1957 .
