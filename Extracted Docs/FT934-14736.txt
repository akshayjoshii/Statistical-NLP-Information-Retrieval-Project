POWER Corp of Canada , the big financial services and communications group , has linked with Hydro-Quebec and Ontario Hydro to form Asia Power , to develop large electric power projects in China and other fast-developing Asian countries . Asia Power , owned one-third each by the partners and initially capitalised at CDollars 100m ( Pounds 49.2m ) , will have headquarters in Montreal but operate from Hong Kong . China early this year finally reversed its policy discouraging foreign investment in infrastructure , including electric power . It is desperately short of power for industrial development and estimates it needs Dollars 25bn ( Pounds 16.5bn ) in foreign investment in the area over the next eight years . Mr Paul Desmarais , chairman of Power Corp , which controls Pargesa with the Belgian Frere family , has visited China regularly since 1979 and dropped plans for a Guangdong pulp and paper mill because of lack of power . He brought China International Trust & Investment into a big British Columbia pulp and paper project later . Power Corp now plans a China communications project with Citic . Canada led a Dollars 100m technical study of key parts of the Dollars 15bn Three Gorges hydro project in China during the 1980s and Hydro-Quebec has helped design several smaller hydro projects being built . Ontario Hydro has also played an advisory role in China .
