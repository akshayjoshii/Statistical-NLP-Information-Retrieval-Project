TAIWAN has approved a series of measures to increase ties with mainland China , but these are likely to be criticised by the island 's business leaders as too cautious . Following a two-day government conference organised by Taiwan 's Mainland Affairs Council , which oversees relations with China , the measures will now go to Taiwan 's cabinet and are expected to be quickly approved . Under the proposals , Taiwanese banks will be allowed for the first time to deal with Chinese banks , but only through overseas offices . Taiwanese financial institutions will also be allowed to conduct certain transactions with the branches of foreign banks in China . Taiwanese businessmen will be allowed to remit money from China to Taiwan , and Taiwan has further relaxed its rules on imports from the mainland . The moves are the latest step in Taiwan 's gradual programme to increase ties with China . But Taiwan again refused demands from business that direct shipping and air links be established . Taiwan 's bans on direct trade , transport and postal links , known as the 'three tongs ' , are seen as important negotiating tools to try to force China to renounce its threat to use force against Taiwan . Taiwanese companies have invested about Dollars 3.6bn ( Pounds 2bn ) in China since they were first allowed to set up operations , via third countries , in 1987 . Processing and labour-intensive industries have moved to China to avoid high wage and land costs on the island . So far few big companies have invested in the mainland , but most analysts agree investment would increase sharply if direct ties were established . Taiwan 's government fears this could undermine the island 's economy . Mr Lin Yu-siang , a legislator opposed to closer Chinese ties at this stage , said direct links could lead 'most Taiwanese factories ' to move to China . 'This is a security issue and would lead to serious unemployment , ' he said .
