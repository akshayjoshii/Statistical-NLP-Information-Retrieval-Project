AUSTRALIA 'S corporate watchdog is embroiled in a public brawl with the country 's top prosecutor over its record of bringing white collar criminals to justice , Reuter reports from Sydney . Australian Securities Commission ( ASC ) chairman , Mr Tony Hartnell , was yesterday forced to defend his organisation against claims by the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) that it was going soft on corporate crime . 'There must not be special rules for corporate criminals simply because they wear white shirts and carry briefcases , ' the DPP , Mr Michael Rozenes , told a parliamentary committee on Monday . He said the ASC appeared to prefer civil rather than criminal action in corporate crimes and accused Mr Hartnell of using one rule for the rich and another for the poor . 'What the corporate criminal is really afraid of is going to prison , ' Mr Rozenes said .
