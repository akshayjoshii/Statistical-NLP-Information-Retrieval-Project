Brierley Investments , the New Zealand hotels and investments group , yesterday said it had acquired a 29 per cent stake in Wilson & Horton and was therefore withdrawing its offer to buy shares in the publishing company . The Horton family , meanwhile , which until last Friday was the controlling shareholder in New Zealand 's biggest newspaper , said it was 'shell-shocked' by Brierley 's raid , in which it bought shares at NZDollars 9.50 each . The Horton and Wilson families have controlled the publisher since 1863 . The company owns the country 's biggest daily , the Auckland-based New Zealand Herald , provincial and weekly papers , magazines and a printing business . In a lightning raid on Thursday Brierley gained 20 per cent from institutions , then bought a further 5 per cent , before offering the same terms to smaller investors . It completed its purchases yesterday . Mr Michael Horton , the publisher 's managing director , had advised shareholders not to sell , as he was 'quite frankly appalled ' by the Brierley move . He said that a previous move by Brierley into the media business had been a blow to the industry , reducing the number of large New Zealand publishing groups from three to two . Brierley controlled New Zealand Newspapers during the 1980s , but had been forced to break it up following the 1987 market crash . Mr Horton 's son Matthew , a journalist in Australia who has been acting as family spokesman , said Brierley was seeking two board seats . Wilson & Horton shares closed unchanged yesterday at NZDollars 9.50 , while Brierley slipped 1 cent , to NZDollars 1.27 .
