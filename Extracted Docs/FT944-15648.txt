The US last night announced that it had reached a framework agreement with North Korea to resolve the dispute over Pyongyang 's nuclear programme which had threatened to destabilise the Korean peninsular . Mr Robert Gallucci , head of the US delegation at the Geneva talks , said that subject to approval by both governments , he and Mr Kang Sok-ju , his North Korean counterpart , would return to Geneva on Friday to sign the 'framework document ' . Mr Gallucci said he was recommending that Washington sign the deal . Mr Gallucci gave no details of the document 's contents but said it addressed concerns about North Korea 's past , present and future nuclear activ-ities . 'It 's a good agreement , ' he said . It served the interests of the US , South Korea , Japan and other countries in the region and he believed the accord would be broadly supported . Under an outline accord reached in August , the US offered to help North Korea switch from graphite-moderated to light-water nuclear reactors which produce less plutonium , and to establish diplomatic ties , provided North Korea agreed to freeze its current nuclear programme and accept full international inspections of its nuclear facilities . This included inspection of two undeclared suspect nuclear waste dumps which could provide clues on whether Pyongyang has diverted plutonium to make one or two atomic bombs . North Korea , which denies having a nuclear weapons programme , has so far consistently rej-ected inspection of these sites . Other key issues in the talks , which began on September 23 , included the financing and organisation of the light-water reactor programme , what to do about 8,000 spent fuel rods corroding in a holding pond at the Yongbyon nuclear complex north of Pyongyang , and the resumption of high-level talks between North and South Korea . Mr Gallucci admitted the deal was 'fairly complex ' .
