ZAIRE 'S COBALT production in 1992 will fall by nearly 10 per cent from a target of over 9,000 tonnes , because of adverse climatic conditions , the managing director of Gecamines , the state-owned mining company said yesterday , reports Reuter from Tokyo . Mr Atundu Liongo , who was in Japan , a major cobalt consumer , for discussions with trading houses . said he was confident that Zaire and Zambia could sustain a producer price of Dollars 25 a lb for cobalt for the rest of this year . But many traders doubted this , saying that demand in the industrialised countries was weakening . The free-market price of cobalt was quoted at Dollars 23.50-Dollars 25 a lb in Europe on Monday , unchanged from Friday . Zaire and Zambia account for 70 per cent of world production of cobalt , a strategic mineral used in alloys for making aircraft engines and turbines as well as audio tapes . Mr Liongo declined to give a specific output target for 1992 and did not give 1991 output . Zaire and Zambia agreed in early June to maintain for the rest of 1992 a producer price of cobalt at Dollars 25 a lb . The two countries raised it to this level from Dollars 11 in 1991 . 'Before fixing the producer price at Dollars 25 , we consulted with our agents and Zambia , ' said Mr Liongo . On 1993 producer prices he said : 'It is premature now to talk about what we will do next year . Let 's see what impact it ( producer price at Dollars 25 ) will have on the market . '
