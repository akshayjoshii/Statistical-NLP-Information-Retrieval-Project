In arguing against term limitations , Polsby states that `` term limitations throw away the benefits of learning from experience . '' Exactly ! What poor Polsby does n't seem to understand is that this is the very reason we want to limit terms of our elected representatives . And what are the major things our representatives learn from experience ? How to get reelected by getting money from powerful special interests , how to build up their personal power bases at public expense , how to use their offices for personal gain , etc .
