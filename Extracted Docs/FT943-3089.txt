PT Barito Pacific Timber , Indonesia 's largest manufacturer of timber products , said net income in the first six months of 1994 rose to Rp103bn ( Dollars 47m ) from Rp82bn a year earlier . The company also reported that net sales increased to Rp481bn from Rp462bn the year before . Barito Pacific has come under fire recently for management at its forest concessions . The company , which ranks as the world 's largest tropical hardwood plywood manufacturer , is majority owned by Mr Prajogo Pangestu . Mr Pangestu recently agreed to allow the Indonesian government to take a 49 per cent stake in two of the forest concessions he operates and which supply Barito Pacific with timber . The Ministry of Forestry said that the move was aimed at improving management at the forest concessions .
