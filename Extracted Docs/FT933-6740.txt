HICKS , MUSE , a Dallas-based private investment company , yesterday became the latest foreign concern to sign a strategic alliance with Taiwan 's ministry of economic affairs . Other companies which have done so include : AT & T , the US telecommunications giant ; Motorola , the communications and electronics company ; General Motors , the vehicle maker ; and GE , which makes aero-engines . These alliances are intended to bring together foreign companies seeking to cut costs and Taiwanese manufacturers eager to acquire new skills . At least five more companies , both US and European , are preparing to sign similar deals with the ministry , according to Mr Paul Hsu , a lawyer involved in the alliances . Taiwanese companies 'are good at making components but bad at integrating them ( into products ) ' , he said . However , Taiwan offers high productivity and rapidly growing local markets .
