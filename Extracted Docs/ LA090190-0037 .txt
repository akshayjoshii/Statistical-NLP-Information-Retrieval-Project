A state law aimed at improving traffic signal efficiency in Ventura has been passed by the Legislature and sent to the governor for approval , state officials said . The legislation gives Ventura $ 200,000 to help it connect 40 of 95 traffic signals to a central Traffic Signal Surveillance System computer within the city . The connection synchronizes the signals , allows them to adjust to traffic flow , detects malfunctions , reduces vehicle delay and improves air quality , said Assemblyman Jack O'Connell ( D-Carpinteria ) . The governor has until Sept. 30 to approve the legislation . SCOTT LAWRENCE
