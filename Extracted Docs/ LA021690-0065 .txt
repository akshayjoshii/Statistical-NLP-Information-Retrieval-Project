A Maltese cargo ship carrying a load of cement apparently sank off western France and 12 sailors are missing , the coast guard reported Thursday . It said the Scan Trader sent a distress signal Sunday night as 96-m.p.h . winds whipped through the Bay of Biscay . Searchers found no sign of the vessel , but lifejackets from the ship washed up on the beaches at Arcachon on Thursday , appearing to confirm fears that the vessel had gone down , the coast guard said . The ship left Bilbao , Spain , on Saturday .
