The Bundesbank has been miserly with interest rates for so long that yesterday 's generous cut in the repurchase rate comes as something of a shock . The quarter-point reduction in the discount rate a fortnight ago has already been reflected in money market rates . This is especially surprising given the improving economic outlook . There are still risks , but German government forecasts of 1.5 per cent growth this year no longer look over-optimistic . Still , the Bundesbank has a record of cutting interest rates after the economy has turned , as it did in 1982-83 . Inflation is widely expected to fall this year , so real rates would rise without further action . Most independent growth forecasts have been nudged higher in anticipation of a strong export performance , which should not rekindle inflation while output remains well below trend . With M3 growth running at 15 per cent in March , money supply poses the only credible inflationary threat . This gives the Bundesbank a strong argument for caution on the pace of interest rate reductions . The explanation for its recent spurt may lie with the foreign exchange markets . The weakness of the dollar this year has meant an effective tightening for Germany , especially if exporters are expected to drive recovery . The Bundesbank may also be trying to relieve pressure on the French franc . Even allowing for its delight in wrong-footing financial markets , though , an official rate cut following today 's council meeting looks unlikely .
