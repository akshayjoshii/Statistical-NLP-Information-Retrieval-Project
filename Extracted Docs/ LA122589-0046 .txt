The editors of Science magazine have for the first time chosen a `` Molecule of the Year , '' representative of the most significant scientific achievement . The first winner is an enzyme called DNA polymerase that can be used in the laboratory for making large quantities of any particular piece of DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid , the genetic blueprint of life ) through a process known as polymerase chain reaction or PCR . PCR is revolutionizing genetic engineering by enabling scientists to make large amounts of DNA without resorting to the techniques that created the field in the first place : inserting a gene into bacteria , growing large quantities of the bacteria , and then isolating the desired DNA . While replicating DNA in bacteria can require weeks or months , PCR makes replication possible in hours . The new technique has made it possible to perform genetic fingerprinting on single hairs or single cells . It has also been widely used in the search for disease-causing genes and in the production of new biological chemicals through genetic engineering .
