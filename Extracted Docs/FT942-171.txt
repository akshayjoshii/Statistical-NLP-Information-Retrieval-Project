The centres of 10 towns could become 'ghost towns ' over the next decade unless action is taken to curb development of out-of-town shopping centres , the Commons environment committee was told yesterday . Mr Martin Chase , director of the Association of Town Centre Management , told the committee - investigating shopping centres - that the problem was most acute in larger towns and cities whose centres were given over largely to retail activity . If more attractive shopping centres appeared nearby , these could draw away substantial numbers of shoppers . Gateshead , in north-east England ; Dudley in the West Midlands , and towns near the Lakeside centre in Essex were cited as examples of centres which had already been severely affected by out-of-town developments . Mr Chase said : 'One retailer estimates that 95 per cent of the business that has been generated in Lakeside has come from business lost in other stores within the Lakeside catchment . ' He added that 'on present trends , 10 town centres would become ghost towns in the next 10 years ' . Mr Chase said smaller market towns could also be 'devastated ' by out-of-town superstores , unless these were positioned to reinforce retailing activity in the town centre rather than compete with it . He welcomed the government's new planning guidelines emphasising the need to protect town centres , and said it was vital they were put into practice . The Royal Town Planning Institute told the committee that 'in seeking sustainable forms of retail development , its distribution can not be left to the operation of market forces ' .
