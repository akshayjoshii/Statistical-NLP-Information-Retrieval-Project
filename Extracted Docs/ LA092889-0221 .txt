Norwegian four-star Gen. Vigleik Eide took over today as chairman of NATO 's military committee , the alliance 's highest military authority . Eide , 55 , formerly Norway 's chief of staff , replaced West Germany 's Wolfgang Altenburg at the end of his three-year term . The chairman of the military committee acts as a link between NATO political authorities and its military commanders , including Gen. John Galvin , Supreme Allied Commander in Europe . NATO officials said Eide , an infantryman by training , is relatively inexperienced for the post and was chosen as a compromise after the most popular candidate , Sir John Fieldhouse , formerly British chief of defense staff , was taken ill in December , 1988 , and later retired .
