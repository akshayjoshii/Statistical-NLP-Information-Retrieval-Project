Protesters in inflatable boats surrounded the former Exxon Valdez before dawn today , climbing her sides to unfurl a banner and chaining themselves to her rudder . Nine protesters were arrested . Harbor Police using bolt cutters freed two protesters from the environmental activist group Greenpeace who had chained themselves to the tanker 's rudder about 20 feet above the water . The pair , along with a third protester attempting to hang a banner from the rudder , were arrested , Sgt . David Rohowits said . Harbor Police Chief Arthur LeBlanc said nine people were arrested . Exxon spokesman Les Rogers in Houston said Greenpeace protesters in motorized inflatable boats pulled up to the stern of the tanker about 4:30 a.m. as the giant ship was preparing to get under way for the Middle East . The tanker , renamed the Exxon Mediterranean in July at the end of an unprecedented refitting , caused the worst oil spill in American history in Alaska 's Prince William Sound in March , 1989 . Kelly Quirke , a Greenpeace spokesman , said four people , including one who fell and hurt his arm , climbed the side of the ship to hang a banner that read `` Sane Energy : When ? '' Protesters also floated an oil boom and a 20-foot inflatable globe about the ship . `` We wanted to blockade the Valdez to call attention to the fact it represents a battleship in the war on the environment , '' Quirke said . `` It has put us in the precarious position of being on the brink of war in the Middle East . '' Once the protest was over , a blanket of fog rolled in and the tanker 's departure was put on hold .
