BURMA 'S military junta has ordered university and college teachers to take courses in enforcing discipline after renewed student protests last year , Reuter reports from Bangkok . Major General Khin Nyunt , the military intelligence chief , said the courses were to teach patriotism , support for the junta 's policies and how to maintain good behaviour among students . Rangoon students demonstrated last month , calling for democracy and release of Nobel peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi . The junta then closed colleges and universities throughout the country .
