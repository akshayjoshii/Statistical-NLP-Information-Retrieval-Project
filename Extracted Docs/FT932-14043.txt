A TRAIN driver was yesterday blamed for the rail crash in which he and three others were killed and 22 were injured at Newton , near Glasgow , last year . Sheriff Brian Lockhart , said in his report on the crash that it could have been avoided if ScotRail had not converted the Newton to Kirkhill line from double to single track weeks before the accident . He said Reg McEwan , 61 , caused the crash by passing a red signal , taking his train on to the single-line where it met another suburban electric train coming in the opposite direction . The crash was the highest-speed collision in British Rail history .
