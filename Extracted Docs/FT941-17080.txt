Sir , Unlike R L Webb ( Letters , January 1 ) , we do not think the introduction of a Pounds 1m monthly jackpot prize will be counter-productive . We know from our post bag that a lot of people will be delighted at the chance of becoming an overnight millionaire . The overall size of the prize fund has been increased , in order to accommodate the new prize structure . And we will continue to pay out more than 185,000 prizes each month in the range of Pounds 50 to Pounds 100,000 , as the odds against winning a prize in any monthly draw remain unchanged at 15,000 to 1 for each Pounds 1 bond unit . We can not please everyone . However , we think that we have the spread of prizes about right . Tom Threlfall , deputy controller , Premium Bond Office , National Savings , Blackpool FY3 9YP
