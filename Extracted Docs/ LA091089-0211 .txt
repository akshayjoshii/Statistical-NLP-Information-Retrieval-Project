A major move is in progress as Southern Pacific Transportation Co. relocates to new headquarters in the Los Angeles Corporate Center in Monterey Park . The firm moves 6 miles east , after 80 years in the Pacific Electric Building at 610 S. Main St. , constructed in 1905 as Los Angeles ' largest office building at 10 stories high . The company signed a 10-year , $ 18-million lease for an 83,000-square-foot building in the 100-acre Corporate Center with Ellis Sloan Burnett Properties and Metropolitan Life Insurance , joint-venture partners in the development of the center . The move , Southern Pacific President Mike Mohan said , `` is consistent with the streamlining of operations of the company , which involves redeployment of SP resources to carry out its business plan for the 1990s and beyond . '' About 350 Southern Pacific employees will settle into new offices this month and in early October , in a consolidation of some Southern California rail , real estate and administrative functions of the company . Negotiations for the Los Angeles Corporate Center lease , were handled by the Faulkner Co. of Los Angeles for Southern Pacific and by leasing representatives for Corporate Center for Ellis Sloan Burnett and Metropolitan Life .
