AMERICAN Express , buffeted by image problems and by losses at its credit card division , has sacked Chiat/Day/Mojo , the advertising agency it chose less than a year ago to handle its Dollars 60m of card promotion . The US advertising world was taken by surprise a year ago when American Express withdrew the bulk of its card business from Ogilvy & Mather , a subsidiary of the WPP Group , and switched it to Chiat . That decision affected a 29-year relationship with Ogilvy which created the 'Membership has its privileges ' and the 'Do you know me ? ' card and travellers cheque campaigns . Now , in a complete reversal , American Express has decided to return to Ogilvy . The change in ad agencies comes at a time when American Express is feeling more competitive pressure from low-fee bank cards and non-bank cards such as those launched recently by General Motors and General Electric . The GM card has chalked up nearly a million new holders in only a few weeks . The big losers are the advertising staff of Chiat/Day/Mojo , the New York agency brought in to replace Ogilvy . Chiat 's strategy involved ads that featured giant American Express cards in golf courses and restaurants . But the company 's share of cards issued actually fell during the first half of 1992 . Ogilvy , meanwhile , has a new 'merchant testi-monial ' campaign that features Arrigo Cipriani of Harry 's Bar and other American Express merchants who speak well of the famous green card . Chiat is still left with the account for American Express gold card in Britain . The reason , according to American Express , is that the switch back to Ogilvy concerned US rather than international advertising .
