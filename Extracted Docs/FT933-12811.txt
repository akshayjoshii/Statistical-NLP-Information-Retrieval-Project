Let 's hear no more carping from bankers about the Pacific hagfish . The scales of justice have at last proved it innocent . Pacific hagfish is the source of 'eel skin leather ' used to make wallets , which has been blamed for damaging the magnetic strips on credit cards . But though the allegation has been swallowed hook , line and sinker by banks' customer service staff , they caught a tartar in passing it on to Edward Melvin . An American biologist with special research interests in the hagfish , he promptly investigated . The rumour just does n't hold water , he now says . The real culprit is the magnetic clasps fitted to many eel-skin wallets .
