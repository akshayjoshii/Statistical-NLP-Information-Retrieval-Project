The head of Mexico City 's police intelligence branch , accused by opposition groups of torturing prisoners during the 1970s and under U.S. indictment , has resigned his post , a City Hall spokesman said today . He said Miguel Nazar Haro , director of the newly created intelligence services of the city police force , tendered his resignation after just over two months in the job . Nazar , 60 , was previously deputy director of the federal security office between 1975 and 1982 , when he resigned after being indicted by a U.S. grand jury in San Diego on charges of participating in a stolen car ring . Government officials reject the charges , but the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said a warrant for his arrest is still standing in San Diego .
