China is using new religious laws to crack down on foreign missionary activity with the arrest in the past week of seven foreign Christians . Amnesty International , the human rights organisation , urged China to release all those arrested . US officials in Beijing said they had been informed that three American citizens among the seven arrested had been released . Earlier this month , China gave notice that it was cracking down on foreign missionaries with the publication of new laws aimed at improving religious 'management ' . News of the arrests of foreign Christians in central Henan province coincides with Beijing 's efforts to persuade the outside world that it is improving its human rights record . President Clinton is obliged within the next few months to decide whether China has made an 'overall , significant improvement ' in its human rights performance that would justify renewal of its Most Favoured Nation trading status . International human rights organisations including Amnesty International have intensified pressure on China and on the US administration in the lead-up to the MFN decision . An estimated 96 per cent of China 's exports to the US are covered by MFN . China 's new religious decree expressly bans foreigners from setting up religious organisations , schools or offices . Foreigners have also been forbidden to cultivate religious disciples among Chinese citizens , and appoint religious clergy .
