The US electronics company Hewlett-Packard has developed what it claims is the world 's brightest light-emitting diode . Clusters of the chips , which are up to four times brighter than existing devices , could replace ordinary incandescent light bulbs where long life and reliability are required , such as in traffic lights . The breakthrough has been achieved through the development of a transparent gallium phosphide substrate which enables significantly more light to emit from the diode than did the traditional substrate , light-absorbing gallium arsenide . The new LEDs should be available within the next six months . Hewlett-Packard : US , 415 857 1501 .
