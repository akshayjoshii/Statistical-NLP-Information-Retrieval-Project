BRUTAL and sometimes fatal torture has become endemic in Chinese jails in the past 10 years , although the country 's law forbids it and China has ratified the UN convention against it , Amnesty International reports today . Amnesty says continued campaigns to crush crime and political opposition have fuelled human rights violations , including arbitrary detention , executions and torture . Its report details dozens of cases , some involving women and children , beaten , shackled for months on end , given electric shocks , and kept in dark cells too small to stand up or lie down in . Amnesty says : 'We believe the law enforcement and justice system in China actually foster torture ' . Prisoners have few rights . Many are abused into confessions . Amnesty accuses China of failing to provide basic safeguards to protect prisoners . Many are held with no right of access to lawyers , and at the mercy of police and guards . China says it follows up cases of torture . A British human rights delegation was told last week that 400 cases of torture were investigated in 1991 , leading to penalties against the torturers . Amnesty cites the same figure , which it believes represents only a fraction of the real number of cases . It urges China to protect prisoners and end the impunity many prison guards enjoy .
