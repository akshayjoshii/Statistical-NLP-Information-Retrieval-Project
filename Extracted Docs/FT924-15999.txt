THE European Commission still hopes to double EC spending on research and development over the next five years in spite of the growing likelihood that member states will rein back the research budget . Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi , the EC 's research commissioner , yesterday unveiled plans for a fourth 'framework ' programme of research and technological development which would involve spending Ecu14.7bn ( Pounds 11.48bn ) between 1994 and 1998 . The 1990-94 programme is worth Ecu5.7bn . Research and development is part of the 'Delors II ' package of proposals to increase the overall EC budget between 1993 and 1997 . But it is one of the areas most likely to be squeezed when EC leaders discuss the final budget at the Edinburgh summit in December . ' I know full well that this is very much under discussion , but we do n't see any good reason at this stage to deviate from the proposals in the Delors II package , ' Mr Pandolfi said yesterday . If Mr Pandolfi gets his way then the funds will be concentrated on certain key areas which the Commission believes can best be dealt with at a European level . They include 'generic technologies ' which might benefit all sectors of industry , and 'big science ' - large research programmes like the human genome project ( the genome is the sum of all genetic material in a given organism ) which require multinational collaboration . The Commission is also keen to encourage co-operation with third countries and international organisations , improve the dissemination of research results and the training and mobility of EC researchers .
