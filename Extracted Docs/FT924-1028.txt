ENTINA should settle down to sustained , investment-led growth with reasonably low inflation and improving external accounts in 1993 , economy minister Domingo Cavallo said at the weekend , John Barham reports from Buenos Aires . Mr Cavallo told the Financial Times : 'In 1993 we expect economic growth to continue at a rate of 6-7 per cent , driven by supply-side improvements through investments and productivity gains . ' He said growth of 8.5 per cent in 1991 and 9 per cent this year was led by a consumer spending spree that was now giving way to more sustainable expansion . He forecast a marked 40 per cent increase in investment that should bring the investment rate to 21-22 per cent of GDP , 'more than enough to justify his growth targets ' .
