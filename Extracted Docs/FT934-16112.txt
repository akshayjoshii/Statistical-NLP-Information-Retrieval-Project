TONI MORRISON , the American novelist , yesterday became the first African-American and only the eighth woman to win the Nobel prize for literature . The Swedish Academy of Sciences , which since 1901 has awarded the annual prizes bequeathed by industrialist Alfred Nobel , said Ms Morrison 's work , mainly concerned with racism in the US , depicted the lives of 'blacks as the people they are ' . Through novels 'characterised by visionary force and poetic import ( she ) gives life to an essential aspect of American reality ' , the academy said . Ms Morrison , professor of humanities at Princeton , was a surprise choice because the prize had gone to writers in English in the previous two years . The West Indian poet Derek Walcott won last year , preceded by Nadine Gordimer , the South African novelist . Ms Morrison , 62 , is the 10th American to win the prestigious prize , worth SKr6.7m ( Pounds 553,000 ) . In a statement issued by her US publishers , she said : ' I am unendurably happy . I , of course , am profoundly honoured . The most wonderful thing for me personally is to know that the prize has at last been awarded to an African-American . ' A teacher of literature , Ms Morrison has written six novels and a number of essays in which the themes of racism , slavery and segregation are often conveyed in violent images . Her novel Beloved , published in 1987 , won a Pulitzer prize . The Nobel judges said Ms Morrison , born Chloe Anthony Wofford in Lorain , Ohio , strove to free language from 'the fetters of race ' . Her work had its roots in the work of William Faulkner - a Nobel laureate in 1949 - and other writers from the American south . It was 'unusually finely wrought and cohesive , yet at the same time rich in variation . ' They described her 1992 book Jazz as richly complex , which sensuously conveyed characters and moods .
