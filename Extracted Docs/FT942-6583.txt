The North Korean nuclear issue may be referred by the US and South Korea soon to the United Nations Security Council for punitive action , following Pyongyang 's refusal to allow international inspectors to examine fuel rods being withdrawn from its nuclear reactor . The International Atomic Energy Agency reported at the weekend that negotiations with North Korea on the inspection of fuel rods had broken down , with Pyongyang continuing to remove them in spite of IAEA protests . The IAEA wants to analyse the rods to determine whether North Korea has previously diverted plutonium produced by the 5MW reactor for its suspected nuclear weapons programme . But North Korea refused all IAEA proposals to secure some of the 8,000 fuel rods to verify that the reactor core is the original installed in 1986 . The reactor was shut down for 100 days in 1989 , leading to speculation that North Korea removed some of the plutonium-rich fuel rods to make nuclear devices . The US and South Korea have warned that if inspection is blocked , they would ask the UN for economic sanctions on North Korea . Pyongyang has said this would be 'an act of war ' . There is a faint hope the issue could be resolved , since two IAEA inspectors remain at the North 's Yongbyon nuclear complex to supervise the rods' removal , which is half completed . North Korea said it would not comply with the IAEA 's demand concerning the fuel rods since it claimed a 'unique status ' , referring to its move to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty a year ago .
