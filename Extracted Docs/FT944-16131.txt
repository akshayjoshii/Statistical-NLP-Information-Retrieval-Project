The leading credit rating agencies differed yesterday on the implications for Mitsubishi Bank 's long-term creditworthiness of its purchase of a majority stake in the troubled Nippon Trust Bank . While Moody 's immediately confirmed its long- and short-term ratings of Aa3 and Prime-1 respectively , Standard & Poor 's and IBCA , the European rating agency , said they were reviewing the bank 's long-term ratings in the light of Wednesday 's merger announcement . S & P and IBCA said they would look at the implications for Mitsubishi 's asset quality . Nippon Trust has a high proportion of non-performing loans and the takeover comes on top of large scale write-offs by Mitsubishi of bad debts on behalf of two other affiliates . Moody 's said it did not expect the merger to have a material impact on Mitsubishi 's capital levels . S & P said it was placing its AA-minus long-term senior debt rating and A-1-plus short-term ratings under credit watch with negative implications . IBCA placed its AA rating of the bank 's long-term debt under rating watch , but left its A1 plus short-term rating unchanged .
