For the second consecutive year , the city of Carson has teamed with two private firms to recycle Christmas trees . Residents are being asked to place their trees -- minus ornaments , nails and stands -- curbside on their regular trash pickup day Wednesday , Thursday or Jan. 4 . Western Waste Industries , the city refuse hauler , will pick up the trees and take them to Kellogg Supply , a Carson-based fertilizing company . The firm will grind up the trees to make compost . City officials said last January 's pickup collected about 8,000 trees that produced 55 tons of compost chips . Flocked trees can not be recycled but will be picked up with other garbage .
