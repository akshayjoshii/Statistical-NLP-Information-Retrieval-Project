NORTH Korea yesterday criticised South Korea for linking economic aid to the resolution of a dispute over mutual nuclear inspections , writes John Burton in Seoul . The criticism , made during a meeting on the nuclear issue , coincides with a visit this week by the North Korean deputy prime minister , Mr Kim Dal Hyun , to industrial facilities in the South . Seoul officials are hoping to use the visit of Mr Kim , North Korea 's senior economic official , to persuade Pyongyang to accept spot inspections of suspected nuclear research facilities in return for investments by South Korean companies .
