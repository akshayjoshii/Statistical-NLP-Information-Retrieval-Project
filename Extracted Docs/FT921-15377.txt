THE GERMAN state railway monopoly , the Bundesbahn , yesterday signed a document of intent to buy 114 Spanish railway wagons for Dollars 80m ( Pounds 42.7m ) to mark the first time that Spain has been able to export its unique Talgo railway technology . The deal , which the chairman of the Bundesbahn , Mr Heinz Durr , was due to sign in Madrid last night , was triggered by Spain 's decision in 1988 to award a Dollars 350m contract for 75 high-powered locomotives to Siemens . The Talgo wagons are produced by a joint venture between Renfe , the Spanish railway monopoly , and a privately-owned Basque group . Talgo ( the Spanish acronym for the Goicoechea-Oriol light articulated train ) is a technology developed more than 40 years ago by a Basque engineer , Mr Alejandro Goicoechea , and financed by the Oriol family during the Franco dictatorship . Franco had ordered Spain 's railway gauge to be wider than the conventional European gauge in order , it is said , to deter invasions . Thus , one characteristic of Talgo is a wheel arrangement enabling it to pass from the Spanish to the French gauge without stopping . The Bundesbahn plans to use the Talgo trains on overnight routes between Berlin and Basle and Munich and Zurich . Talgo 's manufacturers claim that because it is so light it saves on engine energy and that its carriages are connected in such a way that they do not jolt . Essentially , Talgo technology is based on the fact that each wheel has its own axle , placed between and not under the carriages , and which can be independently manipulated . This places the suspension above the point of gravity on each wagon , enabling it to achieve high speeds with reduced lateral movements .
