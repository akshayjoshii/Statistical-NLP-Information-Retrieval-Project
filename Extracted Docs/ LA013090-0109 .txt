The Food and Drug Administration banned about one-fifth of the uses of the color additive Red No . 3 on Monday because it has been shown to cause cancer at high doses in laboratory rats . Under the new rules , FDA spokesman Emil Corwin said , Red No . 3 may no longer be used in any cosmetic product , including lipsticks , powders , blushes , shampoos , skin care lotions or bath oils . It is also excluded from use in cake frostings , cough drops , herbs and spices , flavorings , some processed fruits , chewing gum , cake mixes and dietary foods . Even the wax on cheeses may no longer contain the red dye , Corwin said . The cancer risk is considered so small that the FDA said existing products that contain the color may be used . The ban on Red No . 3 will apply only to new manufacturing . The FDA action prevents the use of the red dye in products where the color is mixed chemically with another additive . Direct addition of the dye to a product will continue , but the FDA announced its intention to halt this use eventually . Red No . 3 is one of seven primary colors approved for food , drug and cosmetic use .
