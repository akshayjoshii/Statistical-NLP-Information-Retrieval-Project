Sir , I was surprised to read David Weeks 's letter ( March 31 ) suggesting that the Jubilee Line extension can be delayed , on the grounds that it serves only London 's Docklands . In addition to improving Docklands access , this line will provide a new high-quality central London rail link to east and south-east London , serving not only the Docklands area , but also the residents and businesses of Waterloo , London Bridge , North Southwark , Bermondsey , Greenwich , Canning Town , West Ham and Stratford . It will also relieve several of the most congested parts of the central London rail network . Passengers on the Central Line between Stratford and Holborn , the District and Circle Lines between Monument and Victoria , and Bakerloo Line between Paddington and Oxford Circus on the Network SouthEast between Stratford and Liverpool Street , will all experience significant improvements in journey comfort . The London Docklands Development Corporation has recently engaged in discussions with Westminster City Council with a view jointly to promoting London to ensure that it retains its position as the premier commercial city of Europe . In achieving this , Docklands will complement the City and West End . The Jubilee Line will play a key role in providing high-quality access between these centres and also in giving access to the Channel tunnel train services at Stratford . It will combine with and reinforce other ongoing rail improvements to provide London with an effective public transport system to compete internationally in the future . For all these reasons the Jubilee Line extension should continue to be supported as a priority project for London Transport .
