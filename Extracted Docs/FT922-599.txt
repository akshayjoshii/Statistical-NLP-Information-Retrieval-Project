A CONSORTIUM of public and private interests is on the brink of launching an effort to rescue RiverBus , London 's loss-making Thames passenger service . RiverBus is due to close on Tuesday as a result of the financial collapse of Olympia & York 's Canary Wharf property development , which had subsidised it . The administrators of Canary Wharf have refused to underwrite RiverBus's losses beyond the end of this month . That means the company is due to become insolvent and close at midnight on Tuesday . Now a consortium of interests in London 's Docklands is close to agreeing proposals to inject Pounds 300,000 into the company to keep it going for three months while attempts are made to save it . The consortium is led by the London Docklands Development Corporation , the state-owned body charged with the regeneration of Docklands . Members include the Canary Wharf administrators , P & O , several large Docklands businesses , and local authorities in the Docklands area . The consortium wants RiverBus to survive because it provides an important transport link between central London and Docklands . RiverBus is believed to be in talks with four interested parties , but none is ready or willing to make an offer .
