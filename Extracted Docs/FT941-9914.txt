Problems at the Euro Disney theme park near Paris yesterday cost Walt Disney its double-A credit rating from Moody 's , the US rating agency . Moody 's downgraded the US entertainment group over concerns that the poor performance at Euro Disney would continue , increasing Walt Disney's financial risks . The rating agency said it expected the company 's debt restructuring talks to result in Walt Disney and the theme park 's bankers agreeing to share the financial burden . The loss of a double-A credit rating can lead to higher debt costs , since many bond investors are prevented by their articles from holding bonds which do not carry a double- or triple-A rating from one of the leading agencies . Standard & Poor 's , the other leading US rating agency , is also considering whether to remove Disney 's double-A rating . Moody 's said it expected Euro Disney 's operating results to remain under pressure 'in the intermediate term , ' even if the restructuring resulted in a reduction in the theme park 's debt servicing costs . EuroDisneyLand has been forced to cut its prices to attract visitors , and has postponed a planned expansion .
