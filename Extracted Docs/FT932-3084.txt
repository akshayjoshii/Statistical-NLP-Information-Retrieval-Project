LONDON 'S heavily subsidised Underground railway could become self-sufficient financially if the government invested an extra Pounds 6.4bn over the next 10 years , the network claimed yesterday , Richard Tomkins writes . London Underground said the extra money , which would more than double government investment in the network , was needed to bring the railway up to date after decades of comparative neglect . The network said about Pounds 8.5bn was needed over 10 years to deliver the 'decently modern metro ' that London deserved . Part of this could be financed through efficiency gains and higher fares . It said the government would recoup the remaining Pounds 6.4bn through extra tax revenues and reduced unemployment benefits resulting from the jobs generated by the railway .
