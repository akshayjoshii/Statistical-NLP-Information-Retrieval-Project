TWO supermarket groups , including Germany 's Tengelmann - said to be Europe's biggest food chain - have announced a boycott of Norwegian food and fish products in protest against the Oslo government 's decision to resume commercial whaling . Norway decided last week that it would allow the killing of 296 minke whales in defiance of an eight-year ban on whaling by the International Whaling Commission . Of the total , 160 whales were allotted as commercial catch ; the balance for scientific research . Tengelmann , which has 4,500 food stores , imports Norwegian food and fish products worth an estimated NKr100m ( Dollars 14.3m ) annually . Total German imports of Norwegian products , excluding petroleum , reached NKr15.9bn in 1992 . Of the total , NKr1.4bn represents food products of which NKr1.26bn is fish , mainly salmon . An executive with the Dusseldorf arm of the Norwegian Trade Council said Tengelmann stressed it would stick to its boycott decision until Norway conformed to the IWC ban . Tengelmann banned imports of food products from Iceland in 1988 when it resumed commercial whaling and has long been known for its green policies . The trade council said that Nordsaade , a member of the Unilever group , had also decided to stop buying Norwegian products from all companies and suppliers which had either direct or indirect connections to Norwegian whalers . The Norwegian government reiterated the argument yesterday that its decision to resume whaling is based on scientific research and responsible management of marine resources . Meanwhile , a spokesman for the Norwegian fisheries directorate , which is responsible for assigning individual whale quotas , said yesterday that 32 boats had qualified for commercial whaling permits , although he added that not all of the whalers had decided to resume the commercial hunt this year . They have until June 4 to respond .
