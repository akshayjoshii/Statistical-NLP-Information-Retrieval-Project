A new job-share program that began in Costa Mesa last month means that city planner Kim Brandt can now spend more time with her 6-year-old and 7-month-old sons . Under the same program , her colleague Kristen Caspers can return to school . Caspers and Brandt , two Costa Mesa employees , are the test subjects in a program developed to help workers scale down their hours for personal reasons while keeping their jobs and benefits . `` We recognize that there are changes in the work force that necessitate creating schedules for qualified , productive employees , '' said Personnel Director Steve Hayman . Both Brandt and Caspers are associate planners with the city Planning Department . Costa Mesa , with 592 full-time employees , will review the program in six months and decide whether to allow other employees to split a normal 40-hour-a-week position with someone else . `` I think for the most part people think this is a good program for women , but men could benefit from it too , '' Brandt said . `` This is good for anyone who wants to go back to school or has to take care of elderly parents . '' Such an arrangement has been available to Tustin city employees for several years . Other cities , the county of Orange , and several private companies now offer the job-share alternative . Employees negotiate among themselves to split up the benefits . Brandt chose not to take the medical coverage offered by the city because she is covered under her husband 's policy . Other employees may decide they do n't need the retirement benefits if they do n't plan on working very long with a city . Job-share employees are credited with a half year for retirement benefits . The arrangement also can affect an employee 's eligibility for increased benefits and vacation time , Hayman said . The employees also split holiday pay . In essence , the two employees share the same job , usually occupying the same work space . MARY ANNE PEREZ
