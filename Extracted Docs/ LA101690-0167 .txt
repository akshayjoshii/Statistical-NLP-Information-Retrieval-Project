South Korean Prime Minister Kang Young Hoon proposed direct trade with North Korea and a visitor exchange involving the elderly today on the eve of the second round of talks with his northern counterpart , Yon Hyong Muk . Accompanied by six other delegates , 33 support personnel and a 50-member official press corps , Kang arrived in Pyongyang at about 1:20 p.m. on the first trip to North Korea by a South Korean prime minister . Kang said on arrival that it is deplorable and frustrating that only South and North Korea are left split while other divided nations of the world are united , but the meetings were a positive step toward reunification . `` Differences in ideology and system between the two parts of Korea must no longer form a barrier dividing the people . The first thing to do to demolish the barrier of national division and become one as soon as possible is to restore Korean ethnic community , '' he said .
