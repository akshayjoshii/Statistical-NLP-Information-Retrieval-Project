PEUGEOT of France forecasts a European market of 200,000 electric cars a year by the end of the decade and is committing at least 'several hundred million ' francs to take a 25 per cent share of it . Mr Jean Yves Helmer , Peugeot Citroen car division director , said yesterday such a market could be achieved without Californian-style legislation forcing makers to sell a minimum number of electric cars . Peugeot is preparing for commercial production of electric-powered Peugeot 106 and Citroen AX models within the next three years , predicting Europe could absorb 10,000 electric cars a year by as early as 1995 . The cars are to be built alongside 'conventional ' models on existing Peugeot assembly lines . The group has already built or taken orders for some 500 electric Peugeot and Citroen vans . Peugeot claims to be relatively unaffected by technical hitches which have marked the industry 's attempts to develop viable electric vehicles . It says costs of buying and operating electric cars can compete with petrol or diesel equivalents .
