Concerns about the enormous responsibilities of Dr Richard Sykes , Glaxo's research and development director and recently appointed chief executive , were partly met yesterday when Dr Goran Ando was appointed R & D director of Glaxo group research , the UK research arm and the company 's largest research arm . Analysts had believed that it was impossible for one man to cope as chief executive and be responsible for R & D . Glaxo last year spent nearly Pounds 600m on R & D - more than any other pharmaceutical company . It has research sites in the UK , US , Italy , France and Spain and employs more than 6,800 R & D specialists . Dr Ando , who joined Glaxo in 1989 as medical director , was made deputy R & D director in March last year . He was responsible for co-ordinating all development , medical and regulatory functions in the company 's international pharmaceutical development programmes . He retains responsibility for world-wide drug development . A 44-year-old Swede , Dr Ando was previously at Astra , the Swedish group , where he was president of the group research centre . Before that he held positions at Pfizer and Bristol-Myers . Dr Sykes retains the chairmanship of Glaxo group research as well as responsibility for R & D on the Glaxo board .
