Two Americans -- one who performed the first successful kidney transplant and one who pioneered bone marrow transplants -- won the Nobel Prize in medicine today . Joseph E. Murray , 71 , discovered how to master the problem of organ rejection and , in 1954 , made the first successful organ transplant , a kidney from one identical twin to another that functioned for 24 years . The work of E. Donnall Thomas , 70 , lessened the severe reaction that bone marrow transplants can cause in the recipients . His work led to a cure for leukemia in 50 % of cases , and in 80 % of childhood cases . `` This year 's laureates paved the way for transplantation in man , '' said the award citation from the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute . Bone marrow transplants are now used to treat a variety of cancers and inherited diseases , and researchers are investigating their potential use in AIDS and other diseases . The award citation said Murray `` pioneered transplantation of kidneys obtained from deceased persons . . . . The field was then open for transplantation of other organs , such as liver , pancreas and heart . '' Murray , who is affiliated with Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston , was in San Francisco for a medical conference when he heard he had won . `` The thing about this that 's marvelous is that Don and I both were in Brigham Hospital together , '' said Murray , a native of Milford , Mass . `` He was a resident in medicine , and I was a resident in surgery . This was after World War II . We both started working in transplants together , but from different angles . It 's marvelous to share it with him . '' Thomas said this morning from his home in Bellevue , Wash. , that he had always thought his work was too clinical to win the prize . There have been 142 medicine prizes since the award was first given in 1901 . Americans have dominated the prize , winning or sharing it 69 times .
