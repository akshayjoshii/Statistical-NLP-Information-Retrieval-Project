The Clinton administration sent new signals yesterday that it would consider ending what has become an annual battle with China over human rights and trade , Reuter reports from Washington . But it stressed this could not happen unless China met minimum US demands for 'significant progress ' on human rights before President Bill Clinton decides on June 3 whether to extend most favoured nation ( MFN ) trade benefits . Mr Winston Lord , assistant secretary of state , told a Senate foreign relations panel : 'In the future we hope the annual debate on MFN would be less central to our China policy . '
