The discovery of a genetic defect linked to Alzheimer 's disease could someday lead to a treatment , a researcher reported last week . In a presentation at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor , Me. , Allen Roses of Duke University said his study of 32 families with a history of Alzheimer 's revealed a common defect on chromosome 19 , one of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes . The progressive neurological disorder afflicts about 4 million Americans . The finding surprised most researchers studying the disease 's genetics because it had previously been thought to be linked to an abnormality on chromosome 21 . That defect is associated with a rare , early-onset form of Alzheimer 's in which memory loss and other symptoms begin to appear around age 40 . Roses speculated that the early-onset form of Alzheimer 's is a different disease . He used his genetic samples to search for a defect on chromosome 21 in late-onset Alzheimer 's disease and could not find it .
