US scientists have identified the rogue immune cells that are responsible for multiple sclerosis . The discovery by Stanford University researchers working with Neurocrine Biosciences , a San Diego-based biotechnology company , could lead eventually to a cure for MS , which afflicts more than 2.6m people worldwide . Although MS has been the subject of intensive research activity worldwide , there is still no effective treatment for the disease , in which the body's immune system attacks the protective coating of myelin protein around nerve fibres . This results in progressive paralysis . The researchers report in the journal Nature today that they have identified the specific type of white blood cell ( T-cell ) responsible for the attack - and matched its genetic sequence to a corresponding gene on the myelin protein . By good fortune , it turns out that the same genetic sequence causes MS in rats ; having an animal model always speeds up drug development . Lawrence Steinman , leader of the Stanford/Neurocrine research team , says the scientists are following three approaches : The primary effort is to make a 'molecular decoy ' which can attract the T-cells away from the myelin . Clinical trials of the first candidate could start next year . Antibodies or other molecules could be developed to remove or inactivate the T-cells . A vaccine could disable the T-cells . 'All three methods focus on blocking or disabling the very specific immune response that causes this disease , without suppressing the patient 's entire immune system , ' Steinman says . Once a blocking technique has been developed , it may eventually become possible to use 'growth factors ' to repair the damaged tissues in MS patients . But the ultimate cause of MS - what triggers the T-cells to attack - is not yet understood . One theory is that fragments of viruses mimic parts of the myelin molecule and trigger auto-immunity .
