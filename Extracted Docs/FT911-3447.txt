The US complains that China has a Dollars 10.4bn visible surplus on its trade with the US . It says that only Japan and Taiwan maintain larger surpluses . As a result , US officials are pressing China to import more from the US . However , China claims that trade is more or less in balance , with a Dollars 1.4bn surplus in the US 's favour in 1990 . One must look to Hong Kong to understand this startling difference . The US trade figures include imports that transit the colony en route from China to the US , and vice versa . But China regards its sales to the US via Hong Kong as exports to Hong Kong . US products entering China from the colony are seen as imports from Hong Kong , not the US . Neither side is ready to alter its trade accounting practices .
