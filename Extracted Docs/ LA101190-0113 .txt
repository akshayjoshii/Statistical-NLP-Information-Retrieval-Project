The University of Miami , a football power trying to improve its basketball image , joined the Big East Conference on Wednesday and the conference commissioner says that probably saved the league . `` To be very blunt with you , our future was at stake , '' Commissioner Mike Tranghese said . `` If the Big East and the University of Miami could not have gotten together , I 'm not certain we had an answer that would have satisfied the football concerns of Pitt , Boston College and Syracuse . '' There was fear that those schools would have joined Miami and others with Division I-A football programs to form an Eastern Seaboard conference . Miami will become the 10th Big East member beginning with the 1991-92 seasons in most sports . Miami football will stay on its own until it can work out a commitment with the three other Big East Division I-A members because the Big East does not compete as a conference in football .
