MR KIM WOO-CHOONG , founder and chairman of Daewoo , South Korea 's fourth largest business group , has emerged as a possible candidate in December's presidential election . The New Korea Party ( NKP ) , formed only last Friday by politicians aligned with President Roh Tae-woo 's majority faction in the ruling Democratic Liberal Party ( DLP ) , is considering offering him its nomination . Mr Kim has not ruled himself out but has expressed doubts about entering politics . The NKP recently staged a party revolt in opposition to the DLP presidential nominee , Mr Kim Young-sam , who heads another faction . The conservative group has also contacted other prominent figures , including Mr Park Tae-joon , former chairman of Pohang Iron and Steel . Mr Kim Woo-choong and Daewoo have close political ties with the administration of President Roh , who is constitutionally barred from running again . Mr Chung Ju-yung , founder and former chairman of Hyundai , the nation's biggest conglomerate , is also a candidate after forming the United People's Party earlier this year . Mr Chung and Mr Kim are bitter business rivals . The former alleges Daewoo has largely prospered due to government support provided under Mr Roh and his predecessor .
