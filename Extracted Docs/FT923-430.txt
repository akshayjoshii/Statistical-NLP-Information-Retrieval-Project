JOHNSON MATTHEY , the precious metals group , has bought for an undisclosed cash amount Alta , a Pittsburgh-based company which claims to be the world's leading supplier of high purity titanium . Demand for this material is expected to grow strongly in the next five years as new generations of semiconductor devices using advanced titanium technology come into production . Mastering the technology necessary to produce titanium of at least 99.999 per cent purity is difficult and JM , which is one of Alta 's customers , is effectively taking a short-cut . Mr Richard Wakeling , chief executive of JM , said the acquisition would strengthen his group 's position as a leading electronics materials supplier and it would help it in its push to win more market share in the Japanese semiconductor industry . In 1991 Alta , which employs about 50 people , made sales of Dollars 10m ( Pounds 5.8m ) and at the year-end had net assets of Dollars 5m . Mr Wakeling said it would make an immediate contribution to profits .
