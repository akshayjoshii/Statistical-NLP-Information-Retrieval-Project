the Toronto Dominion Bank and the Bank of Nova Scotia - are refusing to honour letters of credit they gave to Lloyd 's Names until English courts rule on allegations of fraud at the insurance market . Both banks wrote to Lloyd 's on behalf of two Lloyd 's Names earlier this month . The Names are among about 80 Canadians who face losses as a result of their membership of syndicates managed by Feltrim , Gooda Walker and others . Lloyd 's is playing down the row , which comes amid a mood of growing optimism about prospects for relations between Lloyd 's and its 20,000-plus Names , the individuals whose wealth backs the market . Lloyd 's said yesterday that allegations of fraud 'are unfounded . ' In the first of the two letters , Toronto Dominion Bank wrote to Lloyd 's on November 10 to say it was not prepared to make a payment until ' a ruling has been made by an English court on the allegations of fraud made by our customer against Lloyd's' Separately , the Bank of Nova Scotia wrote to Lloyd 's on November 13 to says that one of its customers claimed his contracts with Lloyd 's were 'tainted with fraud and are void and unenforceable ' . Like other overseas banks extending letters of credit on behalf of Names , the two Canadian banks have 'back to back ' agreements with correspondent banks domiciled in the UK . Lloyd 's said it would draw down letters of credit from the correspondent banks so that any dispute would be between the two Canadian banks and the correspondent banks .
