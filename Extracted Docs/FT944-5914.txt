Meanwhile , the prize for the most imaginative piece of post-Budget scribbling must go to Credit Lyonnais Laing for its 26-page glossy booklet - Kenneth : his new Budget . No one has tried harder to sell a boring Budget to a wider audience . Starting with a flattering portrait of the chancellor , the dust cover promises that Kenneth reveals all : how his spending disorder was found out ; how the markets forced him into a loveless marriage with Eddie ; how his private conversations were later revealed in the press , etc . Plaudits for the book include : 'It 's hard to believe it 's all his own work' ( Norman Lamont ) , to 'Right up to the last page you do n't know how much tax you are going to be paying ' ( Crime Writers ' Guild ) . However , Labour 's Gordon Brown summed it up best - ' A difficult one to follow . '
