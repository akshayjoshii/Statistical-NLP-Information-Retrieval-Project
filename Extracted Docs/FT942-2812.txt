Ever wonder what happened to those high-speed river buses that once plied the River Thames in London ? They are resurfacing in Bangkok , ferrying travellers between the airport and three big hotels along the Chao Phraya river - the Oriental , the Shangri-La and the Royal Orchid Sheraton . Siam Development and Holding has bought the whole fleet of eight catamarans from the administrators of Olympia & York , which ran into such difficulties with the Canary Wharf development in London . Four of the boats will go into service on the hotel-airport run from July 1 . The idea is to avoid Bangkok 's notorious traffic jams . The journey between airport and down-town hotels should be reduced to an hour - it can take two hours on a normal day and more than five hours if the streets are flooded with rain-water .
