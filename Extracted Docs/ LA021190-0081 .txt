Robin Williams and director Terry Gilliam are reteaming -- this time , for a drama . Williams -- who went uncredited for his depiction of the Moon King in Gilliam 's fantasy , `` The Adventures of Baron Munchausen '' -- will star in `` The Fisher King . '' He 'll play a radio-show personality whose career and life take nose-dives . Down and out on the streets of New York , he encounters some street people who lead him on a personal quest . The title refers to a character who figures in the legend of the Holy Grail . Scripted by Richard Lagravanese , `` The Fisher King '' will be produced by Debra Hill and Lynda Obst for Tri-Star . Filming 's set to begin in May on a $ 20-25 million budget , according to a project insider -- relatively modest , compared to Gilliam 's notable budget-buster , `` The Adventures of Baron Munchausen .
