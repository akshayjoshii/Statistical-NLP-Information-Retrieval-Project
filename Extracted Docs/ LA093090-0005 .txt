Time and money have been concentrated on AIDS education , research and treatment at the expense of many other incurable diseases . Bleach , hypodermic needles and condoms are free for the asking -- yet the numbers of those with the virus are escalating . People do have the privilege of choosing the way they want to live -- but if they continually put their lives at risk , do they have the right to increase their demands on others who choose not to live by those risks ? I think not . KATHRYN D. FONTENOT South Pasadena
