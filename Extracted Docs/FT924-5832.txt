The Indian government was yesterday urged to scrap a Dollars 190m ( Pounds 125.8m ) contract to import high-technology railway locomotives from Asea Brown Boveri ( ABB ) , writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi . India 's railway advisory panel said it should develop its own advanced locomotives instead of buying foreign imports . The Dollars 4m spent on commitment payments to ABB should not inhibit reconsidering the contract . ABB declined comment before studying the report .
