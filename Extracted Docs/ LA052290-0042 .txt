American Ecology Corp. said U.S. environmental officials issued a draft plan for controlling ground contamination at a closed American Ecology chemical-waste facility in Sheffield , Ill . The Environmental Protection Agency estimated that its plan , including maintenance of the site for 30 years , would cost American Ecology about $ 12 million in current dollars after adjusting for inflation . But American Ecology , a waste-disposal concern based in Agoura Hills , warned that the cost could increase depending on how the final plan differs from the draft proposal . The 45-acre Sheffield site , which was operated by the company 's US Ecology unit , was closed in the early 1980s after nearby ground water was contaminated . The EPA proposal , among other things , calls for American Ecology to construct a `` cap '' of clay , soil , plastic and other materials that would keep rain and nearby ground water from also becoming contaminated , said Karl J. Eimer , American Ecology 's chief financial officer . The EPA 's draft is subject to public review and comment , and the agency 's final decision is not expected for several months , Eimer said .
