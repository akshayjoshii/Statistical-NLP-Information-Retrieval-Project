Sir , While I much appreciated your support for our cross-border credit transfers initiative , a misunderstanding has crept into your editorial ( 'Paying the price ' , October 20 ) . You claim that 'there may be cases where customers are happy to split charges ' and suggest our proposed directive is 'too prescriptive ' by banning double-charging altogether . Our proposal is that double-charging is banned only in those specific cases where the customer has instructed the banks not to levy a charge on the receiver . Customers would remain entirely free to split the charges if they wished . John F Mogg , director general , internal market and financial services , European Commission , Brussels , Belgium
