Businesses and residents have filed $ 1.1 million in damage claims against the federal government from fires that raged through Yellowstone National Park and surrounding forests last summer , forest officials say . U.S. Forest Service officials are processing the more than two dozen claims , which will be passed on to the U.S. General Counsel 's Office , said Arlene Bateman , who is handling claims filed through the Forest Service 's Region II office in Missoula , Mont . Government attorneys will review each claim to determine whether negligence or nature caused the damage , Bateman said . The Forest Service 's policy to allow fires started by nature to burn unless they threatened lives , property or historic sites generated enormous controversy that has still not been resolved .
