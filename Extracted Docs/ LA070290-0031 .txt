Apparent Suicide Leads to Talk Show Host 's Firing : A New Orleans radio talk show host , whose wife apparently killed herself just hours after calling his show to complain about their marital problems , has been fired . Ron Hunter , 51 , said : `` I was expecting the sympathy of my management and my listeners . And what I ended up with was being fired . . . eight days after the death of my wife . '' Hunter 's wife , Marilou , called his show a little more than a week ago and told a guest marriage counselor that they had a troubled marriage . Hours later , she was found shot to death in bed , next to Hunter . Authorities say she apparently committed suicide . Station officials said Hunter 's dismissal had been in the works for several weeks , but the final blow was the way he handled the call from his wife -- specifically his decision not to cut her off the air as soon as he recognized her voice .
