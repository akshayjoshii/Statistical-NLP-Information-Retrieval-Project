A simple blood test , which could definitively inform expectant mothers whether their child has genetic abnormalities , is being developed by the Applied Imaging Corporation of Santa Clara , and the UK 's Medical Research Council . The only method of prenatal genetic screening in widespread use today is amniocentesis , an invasive procedure involving the removal of some of the amniotic fluid surrounding the foetus . Recently it has become apparent that small numbers of the unborn child's cells enter the mother 's bloodstream . The test being developed extracts these cells for genetic analysis . Researchers believe it will prove a less expensive and risky alternative to the amniocentesis test . Applied Imaging Corporation : US , 408 562 0250 ; UK , 091 516 0505 .
