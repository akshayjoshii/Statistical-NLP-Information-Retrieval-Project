Fears that this year 's strong demand growth for commodity chemicals was merely restocking were confounded yesterday by ICI 's third-quarter results . The figures were unusually strong , even for this stage of the cycle . Heady demand in Asia and the US has led to a change in trade flows , reducing imports into Europe and increasing exports . With rising world demand and limited new supply , prices should rise sharply . Spot commodity chemical prices have already increased , though ICI is yet to benefit fully because contract price rises have only just started coming through . These will be driven still higher when European domestic demand , which has so far remained weak , really recovers . ICI 's downstream businesses , such as paints , may suffer from raw material cost inflation . But such pressures should be more than offset by commodity chemicals . The question remains whether ICI is fairly valued . The issue is one of timing . When its earnings peak , ICI 's shares will stand at a discount as investors anticipate the cyclical downturn . But with possible earnings growth next year of 50 per cent , selling now would be a mistake . The chemical industry typically suffers from supply-driven not demand-led recessions . So the right moment to sell will be when capital expenditure reaches unsustainable levels . Four years ago , the group 's capital expenditure was Pounds 1bn compared with depreciation of just Pounds 525m - a clearly unsustainable ratio of nearly two . Last year ICI 's ratio was 0.9 , suggesting there is a long way to go before over-capacity once again becomes a problem .
