Ansaldo Volund , a Danish subsidiary of Ansaldo , the Italian state-controlled engineering company , and Chung-Hsin Electric & Machinery , its Taiwanese partner , have won contracts worth Dollars 300m ( Pounds 205.4m ) to build waste-to-energy incinerators for two Taiwanese cities , Andrew Hill writes from Milan . The orders are worth about Dollars 200m to Chung-Hsin and Dollars 100m to Ansaldo Volund , for a four-year project which will generate electricity for the equivalent of 20,000 families in the cities of Pali and Hsinchu . Ansaldo , which is controlled by the Italian state engineering group Finmeccanica , said the award would give Ansaldo Volund 40 per cent of the Taiwanese market for incinerating urban waste , or 50 per cent if the share of NKK , the Japanese company to which the Danish group has granted a licence , is included . The group has won orders for two other incinerators in Taiwan .
