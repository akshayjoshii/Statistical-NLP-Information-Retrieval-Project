MPs on both sides of the Commons last night urged the government to refuse trademark protection for brand-name goods facing competition from lookalike products . The dispute has come to a head this week as J. Sainsbury launched a cola designed to compete with Coca-Cola , the brand leader . Mr Patrick McLoughlin , junior trade minister , said the government was still consulting brand owners and producers as well as retail interests , and had not yet been convinced that the issue should be dealt with through the Trade Marks Bill , which is now before the Commons . The bill , which follows a European Union directive rationalising national laws on trademarks , was given a Commons second reading . It has already been approved by the Lords . Mr Nigel Griffiths , Labour spokesman on consumer affairs , said the Consumers ' Association had estimated that lookalike products were 20 per cent to 25 per cent cheaper than branded goods . Mr Griffiths urged the government to refuse to amend the bill to extend trademark protection to brand name goods . He said if it did so it would be pandering to companies with 'near-monopolistic ' shares of the market . Mr Malcolm Bruce , trade and industry spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , said it would be against the interests of the consumer to provide additional protection for brand name goods . Dame Peggy Fenner , Conservative MP for Medway , said there would be considerable relief that the government had not been persuaded to use the bill to give added protection to brand-name goods . Recent opinion polls had shown that 78 per cent of consumers were not confused when choosing between lookalike products and their brand name rivals . Sir Dudley Smith , Conservative MP for Warwick and Leamington , called on the government to give further consideration to what was a 'relatively new subject ' . The bill , which has been widely welcomed by the CBI and other business organisations , was given an unopposed second reading .
