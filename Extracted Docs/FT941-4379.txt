Sir , As managing director of a commercial Internet access provider , I was interested and concerned by Louise Kehoe 's piece on Internet security ( Technology : 'Crime on the line ' , March 3 ) . It is time people heard a commercial Internet provider 's view of security , as there has been no small measure of ambulance-chasing since the advisory on Internet security was issued on February 4 by the Computer Emergency Response Team , the US government-sponsored group responsible for Internet security . The 'Trojan Horse ' program described in that advisory is nothing new . It is one of the oldest hacker tricks in the book , and has happened at many other non-Internet sites . Existing measures and technology for implementing security on the Internet are sufficient and economic : all that is needed is education , and careful and thorough deployment . The 'tens of thousands ' of Internet accounts that have been broken - academic or otherwise - would constitute just a tiny fraction of the millions of Internet users , and the CERT action will meet their problems . The message to emerge from all this is simple : the majority of Internet providers are responsible and take adequate security measures . Such providers are as responsible as phone companies in dealing with security issues , and security practices at commercial sites are in general much more rigorous than at academic or hobbyist sites . These commercial-quality systems have not , to our knowledge , been affected in the recent scare . To liken these security measures to burglar alarms is not analogous . Alarms go off after burglary has been committed - Internet gateways are intended to keep unwanted access out , as much as for facilitating data exchange with other networks , and IBM and other leading corporate users of the commercial Internet appreciate this fact .
