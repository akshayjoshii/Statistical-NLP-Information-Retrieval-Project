North Korea offered Friday to open a small stretch of its border to promote unification with South Korea , but its capitalist rival dismissed the gesture as insignificant . Pyongyang announced that it would open the northern sector of Panmunjom , a border village , on Aug. 15 , according to Naewoe Press , a semi-official South Korean news agency . North Korea said opening the area , about 800 yards long and 500 yards wide , is intended to promote unification of the Korean peninsula . It urged South Korea to do the same . The opening , however , would not permit foreigners to travel past the perimeter of Panmunjom , a truce village that straddles part of the 155-mile border between the two Koreas . The village is jointly controlled by North Korea and a U.N. Command .
