In rebuttal to the Feb. 18 commentary by Gary D. Suttle ( `` A Nowhere Road for $ 40 Million Plus '' ) , I have lived in the Grantville area since 1967 and traffic through our community gets worse every day . Mission Gorge Road from East County to Mission Valley is a disaster . Traffic is usually very heavy Monday through Saturday . Main streets of Grantville and Allied Gardens like Zion Avenue , Waring Road and Twain Avenue are heavily traveled . For me to enter Twain from a side street during the work week from 6:30 a.m. to 8 a.m. is impossible . I must find an opening and streak out on Twain heading west to Mission Gorge Road . After I reach Twain and Mission Gorge Road , I must go through three signals to reach Interstate 8 . The traffic is so heavy in the morning it takes 15 minutes to reach the freeway just from Twain -- and that 's when there 's no accident or construction , otherwise you can triple the time . I know for a fact that people from East County use our side streets of Allied Gardens and Grantville to run parallel with the freeway . They make better time . Opening the Jackson Drive extension would relieve traffic congestion in all what we call District 7 . People who need to get to north city could take Jackson , relieving traffic from Mission Gorge Road and I-8 . People in East County and Del Cerro/Navajo could take Jackson to get to the freeway at California 52 . We voted for the funds to build Jackson Drive -- the voters expect it to be built . We have a traffic problem and we need roads like Jackson Drive . It will improve many people 's quality of life throughout San Diego by helping reduce traffic on I-8 and our residential streets .
