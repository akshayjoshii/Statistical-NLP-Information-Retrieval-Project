THE FBI has arrested and charged two people with the kidnapping of Mr Sidney Reso , the head of Exxon 's international division , who disappeared from his New Jersey home on April 29 , Alan Friedman writes from New York . But in a bizarre twist to the seven-week saga , law enforcement authorities said last night they had not yet found Mr Reso even though they had two of his suspected kidnappers . They said Mr Arthur Seale and his wife Mrs Irene Seale , both from New Jersey , were being charged with kidnapping and conspiracy to kidnap and commit extortion . The FBI said the two had been identified as the authors of a ransom note sent early last month claiming that Mr Reso was being held by a militant environmental group called the Rainbow Warriors . But the FBI believed there was actually no such group . The bureau said Mr Seale was a security employee at Exxon , but left six years ago . The two suspects were arrested while returning a rental car in Hackensack , New Jersey , that the FBI said had been used in connection with the abduction of Mr Reso .
