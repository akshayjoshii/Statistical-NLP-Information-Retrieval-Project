THE CRISIS shaking the Czechoslovak federation intensified yesterday when Mr Vaclav Klaus , federal prime minister designate , announced he would head his own Czech republic instead . Mr Klaus , who as federal finance minister masterminded post-communist reforms , was charged by President Vaclav Havel with forming a new federal government after his party won greatest support in this month 's elections . Meeting newly elected Slovak leaders for a third round of negotiations , Mr Klaus said he did not 'put much faith in a new federal state ' . The future of the Czechoslovak federation has been put into question since the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia ( HZDS ) won 37 per cent of the vote in the Slovak republic . The nationalist HZDS has pledged to declare Slovak sovereignty and adopt a Slovak constitution in the republic 's new parliament when it meets at the end of the month . The two sides agreed yesterday to form a minimal federal government but remained deadlocked over the division of ministerial posts within it .
