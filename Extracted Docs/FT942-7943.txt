Samsung Electronics , South Korea 's largest consumer electronics company , has bought 51 per cent of Lux , the Japanese audio company , from Alpine Electronics for Y2bn ( Dollars 19m ) , writes John Burton in Seoul . It is the first time a Korean company has taken control of a listed Japanese concern . Lux , which was established in 1925 , has encountered financial difficulties because of the high yen . Under its agreement with Samsung , Alpine Electronics also agreed to pay Y2.5bn of Lux 's Y2.7bn total debt . Samsung said it acquired Lux to gain access to advanced digital audio technology that the Japanese company has developed . Lux 's main business is the production of amplifier equipment and components , which are sold under the name Luxman .
