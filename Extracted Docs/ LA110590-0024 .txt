Japanese researchers have identified the defective gene that causes one form of xeroderma pigmentosa , an inherited disease in which sufferers are unusually sensitive to sunlight and are prone to light-induced skin cancer . Although many people carry the defective gene , only about one in 250,000 actually develops the disease . There are believed to be about eight genes that cause different forms of the disease . A team headed by Kiyoji Tanaka of Osaka University reported in the British journal Nature that they isolated the gene causing the most common form of the disease , known as XPAC . It causes about a quarter of all cases . The defective gene , first isolated in mice and then in humans , is thought to be involved in the repair of deoxyribonucleic acid -- DNA , the genetic blueprint of life -- damaged by sunlight . Earlier this year , researchers identified the gene that causes a rarer form of xeroderma pigmentosa , and scientists are currently searching for the remaining genes .
