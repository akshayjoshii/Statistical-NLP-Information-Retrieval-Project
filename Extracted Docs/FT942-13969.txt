The international Human Genome Project - aimed at mapping and identifying the estimated 100,000 human genes - is stimulating rapid advances in laboratory automation . The latest comes from a collaboration between the Imperial Cancer Research Fund , a London-based charity , and two UK companies : Linear Drives of Rayleigh , Essex , and Genetix of Christchurch , Dorset . The three partners have developed a robotic system to help scientists produce the huge numbers of cloned cells required for genetics research . The system locates clone colonies growing on culture plates with a CCD camera . It then 'picks ' healthy-looking colonies with a block of 96 spring-loaded pins and moves the cells to dishes for further growth and analysis . Linear Drives : UK , 0268 770496 .
