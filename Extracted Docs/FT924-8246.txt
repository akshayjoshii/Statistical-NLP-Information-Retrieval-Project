BRIERLEY Investments , the New Zealand hotels and investment concern , has sold a 7.5 per cent stake in Air New Zealand to institutional investors in the UK , Asia and the US . The move reduces BIL 's ownership from 42.5 to 35 per cent , but the company remains the airline 's largest shareholder . The other major shareholders are Qantas , the Australian flag carrier , with 20 per cent , and Japan Airlines with 5 per cent . Mr Bob Matthew , BIL executive director and Air New Zealand chairman , said that BIL intended to keep its 35 per cent interest in Air New Zealand for the long term , but had always planned to sell the parcel of B class shares . The shares are believed to have been bought at around NZDollars 1.35 a share , and were sold at NZDollars 2.70 , ex dividend . Analysts say the sale has no implications for the Australian government's flotation of Qantas . Both Air New Zealand and Brierley Investments have said they were interested in buying a shareholding in the Australian carrier , and they may join a consortium with Singapore Airlines . The Singapore government is the largest shareholder in Brierley Investments , and is also a partner with it in UK hotel group Mount Charlotte .
