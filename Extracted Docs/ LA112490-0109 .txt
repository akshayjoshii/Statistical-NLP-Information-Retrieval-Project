Christmas tree rustling in California 's national forests is one holiday season rite that must be stopped , forest rangers said . `` A lot people think that if I just take one , it 's not a problem , '' said Carla Van Dyne at the Tujunga district office of Angeles National Forest . `` Once they start cutting or even damage ( the tree ) , it is going to die . '' U.S. Forest Service officials said tree poachers are a problem in the Los Padres , Angeles and San Bernardino national forests , stretching from Ventura to San Bernardino counties . Tree thievery is especially serious in Southern California forests because there are relatively few evergreens to begin with , and the trees face disease , insects and smog , foresters said . Los Padres National Forest in northern Ventura County has only six federal employees to keep watch over the 500,000-acre Mt . Pinos reserve . The penalty for taking a tree is usually a $ 50 fine , but the penalty can be as heavy as a $ 5,000 fine and include a one-year jail term .
