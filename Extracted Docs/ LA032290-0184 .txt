Michigan State officials are looking into allegations made in a story in the Detroit News that Spartan football players injected each other with muscle-building steroids . The newspaper , which conducted a two-month study with more than 100 players , parents , police officers and physicians , also said that up to seven players may have fooled NCAA testers on the eve of the 1988 Rose Bowl game with USC by using someone else 's urine , carried in a plastic bag taped inside their armpits and attached to a tube that came out between their legs . Michigan State beat USC , 20-17 . Frank Uryasz , NCAA director of testing , said it was unlikely the players could have pulled off a urine-test scam , adding this type of accusation is `` one word against another . '' Some players said that offensive tackle Tony Mandarich frequently supplied steroids and helped some players who were afraid of needles , the newspaper said . Some referred to him as the `` doctor , '' or `` mentor . ''
