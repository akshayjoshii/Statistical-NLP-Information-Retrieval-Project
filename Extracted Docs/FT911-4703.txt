THE COMBINED pre-tax profit of Finland 's publicly quoted forest groups fell by over 60 per cent in 1990 when compared with the previous year , according to the Central Association of Finnish Forest Industries ( CAFFI ) . Mr Heikki Parnanen , a CAFFI vice-president , blamed the poor result of the country 's forest groups on high labour and production costs . He said that the industry 's debt level was also a big strain . 'The net debt of all Finnish forest companies amounts to around 60 per cent of their turnover ; 6 to 7 per cent of their turnover goes to only paying the interests on the loans , ' he added . Mr Parnanen estimates that it will up to 2 years before the situation improves . 'This year will be even worse than 1990 . The operating margin of all Finnish forest companies is expected to drop from 13 per cent of turnover to under 10 per cent this year , ' he said , adding that export earnings could also fall by 10 per cent in 1991 . The sector employs between 70,000 and 75,000 people . Of these , 6,500 have already lost their jobs with another 6,500 working a shortened week . By the end of 1991 , however , Mr Parnanen estimates the number of unemployed will drop to 10,000-15,000 .
