Especially poignant and praiseworthy was festival director Peter Sellars ' invitation to the local Native American community to participate . The inclusion of indigenous American artists and performers , the reverence and respect for Native American spirituality and the opportunity for the traditional , indigenous cultures of the Pacific Rim to share their arts will have a deep and long-lasting effect on all who were able to be there and even those who were n't .
