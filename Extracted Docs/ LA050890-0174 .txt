A 41-year-old lawyer from a prominent political family took over as president today in the long shadow of Oscar Arias Sanchez , who thrust this country into the global spotlight with his regional peace efforts . Incoming President Rafael Calderon Fournier acknowledged his predecessor 's international renown but said he will concentrate on internal affairs -- without giving short shrift to foreign policy . Arias spearheaded Central American peace efforts that promoted democracy and sought an end to civil wars . He won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for drafting a regional peace plan . Although originally thrilled with Arias ' fame , many Costa Ricans have now come to feel that he gained it at their expense -- by ignoring domestic problems . Even so , he leaves office with an approval rating of 90 % .
