Rogers Communications was yesterday considering a delay in the expiry date for its CDollars 2.8bn ( USDollars 2.08bn ) bid for Maclean Hunter , the Canadian publishing and cable TV group , from March 15 to the end of the month because a US regulatory ruling will probably not be received by next week . Rogers , Canada 's biggest cable TV distributor , applied on March 3 for fast-track approval by the Federal Communications Commission of its proposed acquisition of Maclean Hunter 's US cable TV business and licences . This is a key step in Rogers ' plan to acquire all of the group , including the US and Canadian cable interests and Canadian publishing businesses . Rogers has said it would eventually sell the US cable licences to help pay for its overall bid for Maclean Hunter . But the FCC indicated it could not process Rogers ' application in time for the March 15 expiry date . It promised to disclose its timetable late yesterday . The extension of the expiry date would give Maclean Hunter more time to organise a counterbid . Shares deposited under the Rogers offer can not be withdrawn after March 8 unless the offer is subsequently amended . Rogers was to hold its annual meeting in Toronto today . Rogers and Shaw Communications , Canada 's third biggest cable TV company , have now agreed to swap some of their cable systems . The result would be that Rogers would take control of the key Toronto area in return for selling two western Canada systems .
