Israeli and PLO leaders yesterday parted in disagreement over the peace process , after receiving the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their accord on Palestinian self-rule , Reuter reports from Oslo . Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yassir Arafat made no breakthrough in talks on the terms for much-delayed Palestinian elections - the next stage in the peace process . The two sides agreed to intensify high- and middle- level talks on the critical second stage of the deal - redeployment of Israeli troops away from Palestinian population centres on the West Bank before Palestinian elections are held . Mr Rabin said Israeli security concerns must be dealt with in a balanced way , warning : 'Short cuts might lead to catastrophe . ' Mr Arafat , in his acceptance speech on Saturday , insisted on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Arab towns on the West Bank before elections can be held . Israeli and PLO officials said their delegations would meet again in Cairo on Wednesday for further talks .
