Two months ago a producer-type sat me down and told me that what my movie ( a musical ) needed , in order to sell big , was Tiffany . He said I should dump the actress I had and think `` soundtrack album deal '' instead . That kind of individual is not concerned with entertaining and enlightening an audience with a good movie but whether the neon-colored marketing campaign is in place before anyone has written a script ! As one entertainment attorney droned on to me during a recent meeting , `` All they want is Tom Cruise in a race car . '' If this is becoming the norm , then this business is headed for serious trouble . RICHARD WAY Santa Monica
