Zeneca has submitted for approval a new drug that is likely to affect profits growth within two or three years . Casodex is a treatment for prostate cancer that is estimated by Lehman Brothers , the stockbrokers , to have potential sales of between Dollars 250m and Dollars 500m ( Pounds 323m ) a year . That would make it Zeneca's third-biggest seller . The drug is an oral anti-androgen . About 300,000 new prostate cancer cases are reported each year worldwide , making it the second most common cancer in men . Approval for the drug is being sought first in the UK . Submissions to regulatory authorities in the rest of the European Union and in the US will follow by the end of the year , and it is likely to reach the market in 1995 . Other companies making or developing anti-androgens include Schering Plough and Johnson & Johnson of the US . Casodex 's approval would place Zeneca more firmly in the cancer market . It already has Nolvadex and Zoladex in the area , but both are outsold by heart treatments Zestril and Tenormin .
