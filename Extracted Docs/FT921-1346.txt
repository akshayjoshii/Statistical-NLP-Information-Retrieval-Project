THE PROSPECT of an early reduction in Germany 's official interest rates receded further yesterday with news that money supply growth continued to exceed the Bundesbank 's target range by a wide margin in February . The central bank said M3 , the broad monetary aggregate , expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 per cent last month compared with the average in the fourth quarter of 1991 . This was a slight decline on the 9 per cent rate in January , but economists said M3 expansion was still too high to allow any scope for relaxing monetary controls . The target range is growth of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent this year . The Bundesbank lifted interest rates by half a point in December to leave the discount rate at 8 per cent and the Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent . Chancellor Helmut Kohl is understood to have backed the Bundesbank 's tough monetary line when he attended its council meeting last Thursday . The Bundesbank said the main force propelling M3 was the volume of bank lending to companies and individuals , though this had weakened slightly ; long-term lending remained strong , while short-term lending eased . In the past six months , it has risen at an annual seasonally adjusted rate of 11.5 per cent .
