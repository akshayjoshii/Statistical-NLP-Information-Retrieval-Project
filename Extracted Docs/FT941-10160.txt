Enterprise Oil Norge , the Norwegian unit of London-based Enterprise Oil , yesterday announced that it would fund a NKr400m ( Pounds 36m ) , three-year Norwegian North Sea exploration programme in exchange for the right to farm into three licences operated by Esso Norge . The deal boosts Enterprise 's net acreage on the Norwegian Continental Shelf by 25 per cent , or 298 sq km , and gives the company a 50 per cent stake in each of the three blocks within the Esso licenses . Domestic analysts said they believed the deal to be the biggest of its kind ever concluded in Norway . Enterprise said that portions of blocks 16/1 , 25/8 and 25/20 in the Utsira High area with proven hydrocarbons were specifically excluded from the farm-in . The company explained that it had agreed the farm-in with Esso to make greater and faster progress in building its Norwegian North Sea portfolio than what otherwise could be accomplished under Norway 's licensing regime . Enterprise intends to drill three exploration wells - one this year in block 25/8 near Esso 's producing Balder field - and to undertake three dimensional seismic surveys over the bulk of the farm-in acreage . Including the farm-in well , the company plans to drill up to 10 exploration wells this year elsewhere on Norwegian shelf acreage , or one-third of all wells to be drilled in the sector , representing its heaviest ever exploration programme since entering Norway in 1989 , when it acquired acreage from Texas Eastern . The two companies have already secured approval of the agreement by Norway's industry and energy ministry and finance ministry .
