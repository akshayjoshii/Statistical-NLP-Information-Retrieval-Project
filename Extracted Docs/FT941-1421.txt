Striking regional variations are revealed by the first atlas of cancer incidence in England and Wales , published yesterday , Clive Cookson writes . The atlas , commissioned by the Cancer Research Campaign , shows that lung cancer , the most common form of the disease in men , is much more prevalent in the north than in the south . The reverse is true for breast cancer , the most common cancer in women . Dr Isabel Silva and Dr Anthony Swerdlow of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine analysed information about 3m new cancer patients between 1968 and 1985 to give a county-by-county variation in cancer risks . They compared these with the geographical distributions of risk factors such as smoking and occupation . The figures in the map above are an index of the number of new cases in each county over the period . In some cancers there is an obvious link with risk factors . The north-south gradient in lung cancer is caused mainly by the greater prevalence of smoking in the north . The authors say that greater industrial exposures to smoke , dust and toxic fumes in the north are not sufficient to account for the regional differences . Malignant melanoma , the most virulent skin cancer , has a strong south/north gradient - someone living on the south coast is three times more likely to suffer than someone in northern England . There is a clear correlation with hours of sunshine . The reason why breast and ovarian cancers are more common in the south is not obvious . The fact that southern women have fewer children on average may be a partial explanation , Drs Silver and Swerdlow say , because they have higher levels of the hormones related to these cancers .
