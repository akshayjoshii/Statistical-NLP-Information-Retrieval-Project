Great American May Violate Capital Rules : San Diego-based Great American Bank , the nation 's eighth-largest thrift , said it will be unable to meet certain new federal capital requirements by a Dec. 7 deadline . The thrift said it expected to continue operating under normal conditions but would have to apply for regulatory approval if its board decided to declare a regular quarterly dividend in January . Great American said it currently meets the tangible capital requirement of 1.5 % of assets and is `` just a hair shy '' of the core capital requirement of 3 % of assets .
